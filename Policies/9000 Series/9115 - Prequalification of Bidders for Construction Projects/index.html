<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 9115</p>
<p>PREQUALIFICATION OF BIDDERS
FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS                                               Policy Code:           9115</p>
<p>A.    GENERAL</p>
<pre><code>  1.     The Avery County School Board recognizes that the purpose of this
         prequalification process is to impartially evaluate a contractor, and to properly
         determine by its responsible business practices, work experience, manpower, and
         equipment that it is qualified to bid on a board construction project, including prime
         contracts awarded by construction managers pursuant to the Construction Manager
         at Risk (“CM at Risk”) process. The award of contracts should be the result of open
         competition in bidding; impartiality in the selection of contractors; integrity in
         business practices; and skillful performance of public contracts.

  2.     The administration shall be responsible for prequalifying individual contractors to
         bid on board construction projects when the administration believes
         prequalification is preferred. The administration is not required to prequalify
         contractors for any particular project or projects. However, a contractor shall not
         be allowed to submit a bid on a construction project subject to prequalification,
         unless it has been prequalified in accordance with board policy.

  3.     The construction manager and the administration shall jointly develop the
         assessment tool and criteria for each CM at Risk project, including the
         prequalification scoring values and minimum requirement score. The construction
         manager shall use the process outlined in this policy for the prequalification of
         contractors on CM at Risk projects.

  4.     Notwithstanding the fact that a contractor was prequalified, the board,
         administration, and construction manager reserve the right to reject a contractor’s
         bid if it is determined that the contractor has not submitted the lowest responsible
         and responsive bid. The prequalification of the contractor shall not preclude the
         board, administration, or construction manager from subsequently concluding that
         the contractor is not a responsible bidder pursuant to G.S. 143-129. The
         prequalification of a contract for a project shall only apply to the individual project.
         All construction and repair contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsive and
         responsible bidder, taking into consideration quality, performance, and the time
         specified in the proposals for the performance of the contract.

                                                                           Policy Code:           9115</p>
<pre><code>    1.      The superintendent or designee shall designate a school official to oversee the
            prequalification process for each individual project (“School Prequalification
            Official”).

    2.      Each prospective bidder on contracts identified for prequalification by the
            administration and all CM at Risk projects shall submit an application on the
            approved prequalification application form in order to become prequalified. The
            approved prequalification application form will require information to be provided
            on the ownership of the firm, experience of the firm’s personnel, any affiliations
            with other construction firms, bonding capacity, financial resources, the type of
            work performed by the firm, and other objective criteria rationally related to the
            contract to be awarded.

    3.      The administration shall ensure that applications prepared for the projects comply
            with this policy and State law. The application is to be submitted by the deadline
            established in the notice of prequalification. The act of submitting the application
            does not permit the firm to submit a bid. Incomplete applications will be rejected
            or returned for further detail or correction in the sole discretion of the school system
            or construction manager.
</code></pre>

<pre><code> 6. Capacity – Firms shall demonstrate sufficient bonding capacity, insurance, and resources

 7. Legal Authorization – All firms must show that they are legally authorized to conduct
 business in the State of North Carolina and with the school system and have all required
 licensure for the work to be performed.
</code></pre>
<p>D.      REVIEW OF APPLICATION – SCHOOL SYSTEM BID PROJECTS</p>
<pre><code>    1.      Prequalification Committee – The School Prequalification Official shall establish a
            committee to review and score applications, including approving and denying
            prequalification (“Prequalification Committee”). The superintendent or designee
            shall not be a member of the Prequalification Committee.

    2.      Review of Applications – The school system’s Prequalification Committee shall
            use the school system’s objective assessment process. The prequalification criteria
            shall not require the firm to have previously been awarded a construction or repair
            project by the school system. The prequalification criteria used by the
            Prequalification Committee shall include prequalification scoring values and the
            minimum required score to be prequalified for the project. The school system’s
            Prequalification Committee shall approve or deny the applications in accordance
            with the prequalification criteria and scoring system.

    3.      Notice of Decision – The firms shall be promptly notified of the school system’s
            Prequalification Committee’s decision, including the reason for denial, via e-mail.

 Prequalification Committee within three business days of receipt of notice that the firm has
 been denied prequalification. The written appeal shall clearly articulate the reasons why the
 firm is contesting the denial and attach all documents and additional information supporting
 the firm’s position. The Prequalification Committee may contact the firm regarding the
 information provided prior to ruling on the appeal. If the Prequalification Committee is
 satisfied that the firm should be prequalified, the firm shall be notified that it is prequalified to
 bid on the project and allowed to participate in the bid process. If the Prequalification
 Committee upholds its denial, the firm shall be promptly notified in writing via e-mail.

 2. Hearing – The firm may appeal the Prequalification Committee’s decision on the written
 appeal by requesting a hearing before the superintendent or designee via hand-delivery or e-
 mail within three (3) business days of the receipt of the Prequalification Committee’s decision.
 The hearing shall be held within five (5) business days. The firm shall not be allowed to submit
 additional information without the written consent of the superintendent or designee. The firm
 shall be allowed thirty (30) minutes for the hearing. In the event the superintendent or designee
 is unable to hold a hearing in a timely manner, he/she may designate a school official to handle
 the appeal.

 3. Decision – For projects bid by the school system, the decision of the superintendent or
 designee or designee shall be final, and the firm shall be promptly notified of the decision via
 e-mail. For CM at Risk projects, the superintendent or designee shall notify the construction
 manager of its recommended decision. The construction manager shall review the
 recommended decision and issue a final decision to the school system and firm. In the event
 the construction manager rejects a recommendation from the superintendent or designee to
 prequalify the firm, the construction manager shall provide a written explanation of the denial
 to both the superintendent or designee and the firm.

 4. General Rules for Appeals – Firms submitting applications shall be provided an e-mail
 address for communication with the construction manager or school system during the appeal
 process. The firm shall provide at least two e-mail addresses for use by the school system or
