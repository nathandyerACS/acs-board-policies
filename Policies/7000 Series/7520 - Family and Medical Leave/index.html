<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 7520</p>
<p>FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE</p>
<p>All eligible employees will be provided with leave as required by the federal Family and Medical
Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and applicable state laws and State Board of Education policies.
The FMLA allows eligible employees to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute
appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks
(or 26 workweeks in certain cases) in any 12-month period for certain qualifying conditions or
events. The employee may continue to participate in the school system’s group insurance plan
while on FMLA leave.</p>
<p>This policy is intended for guidance only and is not intended to alter or expand the school
system’s responsibilities beyond the requirements of law. If any provision of this policy is
inconsistent with federal law or regulation, the federal rule must take precedence. The
superintendent is authorized to develop additional regulations for FMLA leave consistent with
the requirements of the law and this policy. Employees can find more information about FMLA
leave in the North Carolina Public Schools Benefits and Employment Policy Manual.</p>
<p>The board strictly prohibits interfering with, restraining or denying the ability of any employee to
exercise any right provided by the FMLA. The board also strictly prohibits any type of
discrimination against or discharge of an employee who has filed a complaint in regard to the
FMLA. A copy of this policy will be provided to each employee upon hiring.</p>
<p>A.      DEFINITIONS</p>
<pre><code>    1. Serious Health Condition

            A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental
            condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility or
            continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents
            the employee from performing the functions of the employee’s job or prevents the
            qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities.

    2. Continuing Treatment

            Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement in the above
            definition of “serious health condition” may be met by a period of incapacity of
            more than three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a
            health care provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment or
            incapacity due to pregnancy or a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet
            the definition of continuing treatment.

    3. Other Terms

            Unless otherwise noted, all terms in this policy must be defined in accordance
            with 29 C.F.R. pt. 825.

B. ELIGIBILITY</p>
<pre><code>       Generally, employees are eligible for unpaid FMLA leave if they have:
       1.    been employed by the school system for at least 12 months (but not necessarily
              consecutively); and
       2.    worked at least 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months.

       Further information about these requirements can be found in the Code of Federal
       Regulations at 29 C.F.R. 825.110.
</code></pre>
<p>C. QUALIFYING CONDITIONS</p>
<pre><code>       Except in cases of leave to care for a covered service member with a serious illness or
       injury, an eligible employee is entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of FMLA leave during
       any 12-month period for any one or more of the following reasons:

       1.      the birth and first-year care of the employee’s child;
       2.      adoption or foster placement of a child with the employee;
       3.      a serious health condition of the employee or the employee’s spouse, child or
               parent;
       4.      a qualifying exigency (see Section F) arising out of the fact that the spouse or a
               son, daughter or parent of the employee has been deployed, or is on notice of an
               impending deployment to a foreign country as a member of the regular Armed
               Forces on active duty or as a member of the Reserves components of the Armed
               Forces under a federal call or order to active duty in support of a contingency
               operation; or
       5.      to care for a covered service member with a serious illness or injury (“covered
               service member” and “serious injury or illness” are defined in federal regulation
               29 C.F.R. 825.127). An employee who is a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next
               of kin of the service member may take leave for a period of up to 24 workweeks
               under this provision.
</code></pre>
<p>D.      DETERMINING THE 12-MONTH LEAVE PERIOD</p>
<pre><code>       The 12-month period during which an employee is eligible for FMLA leave will be from
       July 1 to June 30. Exception: The period for leave to care for a covered service member
       with a serious injury or illness begins on the first day the employee takes leave for this
       reason and ends 12 months later.
</code></pre>
<p>E. ENTITLEMENT TO LEAVE</p>
<pre><code>       Eligible employees may take leave as follows:
           1. Medical leave for serious health conditions: A combined total of 12
               workweeks during a 12-month period. The leave may be taken intermittently or
               on a reduced leave schedule as is medically necessary.
           2. Family leave for pregnancy, birth of a child or placement of a child for foster
               care or adoption: A combined total of 12 consecutive workweeks during a 12-
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520                                             Page 2 of 9
                month period. Eligibility for FMLA leave expires 12 months from the birth,
                foster care placement or adoption of the child. Leave must be used in a single
                block of time unless the board agrees to another arrangement.
             3. Military service exigency: A combined total of 12 workweeks during a 12-
                month period. The leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave
                schedule.
             4. Leave to care for injured service member: A combined total of no more than
                26 workweeks during a single 12-month period. The leave may be taken
                intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. If combined with other types of
                FMLA leave, the total leave taken in a single 12-month period still may not
                exceed 26 weeks.
             5. Spouses employed by the school system: Spouses who are both employed by
                the school system and eligible for FMLA leave are limited in the amount of
                family leave they may take for the birth and care of a newborn child, for the
                placement of a child for adoption or foster care or to care for a parent who has a
                serious health condition to a combined total of 12 weeks (or 26 weeks if leave to
                care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness is also used).</p>
<p>F.      QUALIFIED MILITARY SERVICE EXIGENCIES</p>
<pre><code>    A military service exigency that qualifies for FMLA leave must be defined in accordance
    with federal regulations. Qualified exigencies may include:

    1.   short notice deployment;
    2.   military events and related activities;
    3.   school and childcare activities;
    4.   financial and legal arrangements;
    5.   counseling;
    6.   rest and recuperation leave;
    7.   post-deployment activities;
    8.   parental care; and
    9.   additional activities agreed upon by the board and employee.
</code></pre>
<p>G.      INTERMITTENT OR REDUCED WORK SCHEDULE</p>
<pre><code>         1. An employee may take FMLA on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule as
            required for the health of the employee or family member, due to a qualifying
            exigency, or as otherwise approved by the superintendent. The employee must
            make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the
            operations of the school. Whenever possible, employees should discuss
            scheduling with his or her immediate supervisor prior to scheduling any medical
            treatment in order to accommodate the work schedule.
         2. An employee requesting intermittent or reduced leave time for medical treatment
            of a serious health condition may be required to give the reasons for the
            intermittent or reduced leave schedule and the schedule for treatment.
         3. To better accommodate an employee's need for intermittent or reduced leave for a
            serious health condition, the school system may require an employee to take an

               alternative position during the period of leave. The alternative position must have
               equal pay and benefits, but it does not have to have equivalent duties.
            4. Employees may take intermittent leave in increments of one hour.
            5. Instructional personnel are subject to special rules for taking intermittent or
               reduced leave. (See section H.)</p>
<p>H.      INSTRUCTIONAL PERSONNEL</p>
<pre><code>    The following special rules apply to instructional personnel only. For purposes of this
    policy, instructional personnel are teachers, athletic coaches, driving instructors, special
    education assistants and any other employee whose principal function is to teach and
    instruct students.

    1. Use of Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave

        a) Instructional employees may use intermittent or reduced schedule leave only
           when the employee and the school system have reached an agreement on how the
           leave will be used.

        b) If an instructional employee requests intermittent or reduced schedule leave for
           more than 20 percent of the working days of the duration of a leave due to
           medical treatment, the school system may require the employee to take
           continuous leave for up to the entire duration of the scheduled leave or to transfer
           to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits for the period of leave.

        c) Instructional employees taking intermittent or reduced schedule leave that
           constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during the leave period are not
           subject to transfer to an alternative position.

    2. Extension of FMLA Leave at School System Discretion

            The school system may require instructional personnel to continue leave through
            the end of the school semester if any of the following conditions exist:

        a) the leave will begin more than five weeks before the end of the term; the leave
           will last at least three weeks; and the employee would return to work in the last
           three weeks of the academic term;

        b) the leave is for a purpose other than the employee's own serious health condition
           or for a military exigency; the leave will begin in the last five weeks of the term;
           the leave will last more than two weeks; and the employee would return to work
           during the last two weeks of the academic term; or

        c) the leave is for a purpose other than the employee's own serious health condition
           or for a military exigency; the leave will begin in the last three weeks of the term;
           and the leave will last at least five days.
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520                                              Page 4 of 9
        If the school system requires an instructional employee to take leave until the end of the
        academic term, only the period of leave until the employee is ready and able to return to
        work will be charged against the employee's FMLA entitlement.</p>
<p>I.      EMPLOYEE'S RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN REQUESTING LEAVE</p>
<pre><code>    To ensure that employees receive proper notification of their rights and responsibilities
    and that leave is properly designated, all employees requesting any type of leave must
    make the request to the director of human resources or designee.

    1.      Employee's Responsibility When Leave is Foreseeable

         a) The employee must provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA
            leave when the need is foreseeable. If this amount of notice is not possible, then
            notice must be given as soon as practicable, taking into account all of the facts
            and circumstances.

         b) Employees must provide sufficient information for the school system reasonably
            to determine (1) whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request and (2) the
            anticipated timing and duration of the leave. This information would include, for
            example, notice that the employee is unable to perform job functions, notice that
            the family member is unable to perform daily activities, notice of the need for
            hospitalization or continuing treatment by a health care provider or notice of
            circumstances     supporting    the     need   for    military  family     leave.

         c) If the employee does not provide 30 days' notice and there is no reasonable
            justification for the delay, the school system may delay the FMLA leave until at
            least 30 days after the employee provides notice of the need for FMLA leave.

         d) If an instructional employee fails to give the required notice of foreseeable leave
            for an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, the school system may require the
            employee to take continuous leave for the duration of his or her treatment or may
            temporarily transfer the employee to an alternative position for which the
            employee is qualified and that has the same benefits. (See section H.)

    2. Employee’s Responsibilities When Leave is Not Foreseeable

         a) When leave is not foreseeable, employees must comply with the usual school
            system procedures for notifying their supervisors of the absence and requesting
            leave, including any applicable requirements established in policy 7510, Leave of
            Absence. If the employee fails to do so, the leave may be delayed or denied.

         b) When giving notice of absence, the employee must inform the supervisor if the
            requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or
            certified.

         c) Employees also must notify the director of human resources or designee of the
            need for FMLA leave as soon as practicable.

            d) All employee responsibilities in the FMLA for notice, medical certification,
               fitness for duty certification and notice of intent to return to work apply as
               specified in this policy and policy 7510.</p>
<p>J.      SCHOOL SYSTEM’S DESIGNATION AND NOTICE TO EMPLOYEE</p>
<pre><code>    1. Whether or not the employee specifically asks for FMLA leave, it is the responsibility
       of the assistant superintendent of human resources or designee to ask any questions
       necessary of the employee in order to make a determination of whether the leave is
       FMLA-eligible, unless the employee has already requested and received FMLA leave
       or certification for the same condition or event. The assistant superintendent may
       require notice of the need and the reason for leave.

    2. The director for human resources or designee shall provide all legally-required
       notices to the employee within five days of receiving this information or otherwise
       learning that an employee’s leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, unless
       there is a justifiable delay, such as a delay for documentation.

        The required notices must indicate whether the employee is eligible under the FMLA.
        If the employee is eligible, the notice must specify any additional information
        required from the employee as well as the employee’s rights and responsibilities
        under the FMLA. If the employee is not eligible, the notice must provide a reason for
        the ineligibility. The required notices also must include whether the leave will be
        designated as FMLA-protected and, if so, the amount of leave counted against the
        employee’s leave entitlement.

    3. Leave may be designated as both FMLA-eligible and as leave under the school
       system’s paid leave policy if paid leave has been substituted. Such leave would be
       counted towards the 12-week FMLA entitlement. In addition, the director of human
       resources may designate an absence (taken as paid or unpaid leave) that meets the
       criteria for an FMLA-qualifying absence as part of the employee’s total FMLA
       entitlement, whether or not the employee has requested FMLA leave. (See section
       M.)

    4. Leave that has been taken for an FMLA-qualifying reason may be retroactively
       designated as FMLA leave, with appropriate notice to the employee, provided that
       doing so does not cause harm or injury to the employee.
</code></pre>
<p>K.      CERTIFICATION</p>
<pre><code>    The school system reserves the right to require employees to provide certification of any
    FMLA-qualifying event or condition of the employee or the employee’s spouse, child,
    parent or next of kin, including certification for military exigency leave. The school
    system will not request more medical certification information than that allowed by the
    FMLA and the Americans With Disabilities Act. The director of human resources or
    designee may request a second or third opinion at the school system’s expense if reason
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520                                            Page 6 of 9
        to doubt the validity of a medical certification exists. The school system may require
        periodic recertification to support the leave, as permitted by law.</p>
<p>L.      RETURN TO WORK</p>
<pre><code>    The school system may require an employees to periodically report on his or her status
    and intent to return to work. Any employee who it taking leave through the end of an
    academic semester must report on his or her intent to return to work no later than four
    weeks before the end of the academic semester. In addition, the school system may
    require the employee to report on his or her intent to return to work on a regular basis
    while on FMLA leave.

    Before an employee returns to work from FMLA leave taken for the employee’s own
    serious health condition, the employee must present a "fitness-for-duty" certification that
    states that the employee is able to return to work. This requirement does not apply to an
    employee taking intermittent leave unless the employee’s condition presents a reasonable
    safety concern.
</code></pre>
<p>M.      SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE</p>
<pre><code>    1. The school system will substitute appropriate paid leave, including sick leave,
       personal leave and vacation time for unpaid, FMLA leave to the extent allowed by law
       and policy, giving proper notice to the employee that the leave is designated FMLA.
       If an employee’s accrued paid leave is exhausted but an FMLA-qualifying reason for
       absence continues, the resulting absences will be protected FMLA leave until all
       allowable FMLA leave has been used, but such absences will be unpaid.

    2. When an employee has an absence (taken as paid or unpaid leave) that meets the
       criteria for an FMLA-qualified absence, the absence may, with proper notice to the
       employee, be designated part of the employee’s total annual FMLA entitlement. If the
       absence continues for more than 10 days, all employee responsibilities in the FMLA
       to provide notice for foreseeable and unforeseeable leave, medical certification, fitness
       for duty certification and notice of intent to return to work apply as specified in this
       policy and policy 7510.

    3. An employee must not be permitted to exhaust paid leave before beginning FMLA
       leave if it has been determined that the employee’s reason for using paid leave meets
       the FMLA eligibility requirements.
</code></pre>
<p>N.      RESTORATION TO EQUIVALENT POSITION</p>
<pre><code>    1. Generally

    Employees, except "key" employees, will be restored to the same or an equivalent
    position upon return from FMLA leave.
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520                                              Page 7 of 9
        The equivalent position will have virtually identical pay, benefits and working
        conditions, including privileges, prerequisites and status, as the position held prior to the
        leave. The position also must involve substantially similar duties and responsibilities,
        which must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility and authority. All
        positions within the same job classification are considered "equivalent positions" for
        purposes of this policy, so long as these conditions are met. For licensed employees, all
        positions with the same salary and licensure requirements also will be considered
        equivalent positions, so long as these conditions are met.</p>
<pre><code>    2. Key Employees

    Key employees do not have the right to be restored to the same or an equivalent position
    upon return from FMLA leave. Key employees are salaried FMLA-eligible employees
    who are among the highest paid 10 percent of all employees. If restoring a key employee
    would result in substantial and grievous economic injury to the school system, then the
    school system has no obligation to restore the employee to the same or an equivalent
    position.

    Employees will be informed at the time leave is taken if he or she is considered a key
    employees and will be informed once a determination is made that the employee will not
    be restored to the same or an equivalent position upon their return. A key employee who
    has been informed that he or she will not be restored still has the rights to health benefits
    for the full period in which he or she is eligible for FMLA leave.
</code></pre>
<p>O.      CONTINUATION OF HEALTH BENEFITS</p>
<pre><code>    Health care coverage and benefits will be continued for the duration of an employee’s
    FMLA leave on the same conditions as would have been provided if the employee had
    continued working. Employees do not have the right to the accrual of earned benefits
    during FMLA leave. If an employee takes intermittent or reduced leave, he or she has
    the right to maintain the same health care benefits, but earned benefits may be reduced in
    proportion to hours worked when such a reduction is normally based upon hours worked.

    The school system may recover from the employee the cost of health insurance premiums
    paid on behalf of the employee while the employee was on unpaid FMLA leave if the
    employee does not return to work after leave, so long as the reason for not returning does
    not relate to a serious health condition or to circumstances beyond the employee's
    control.
</code></pre>
<p>P.      POSTING REQUIREMENT</p>
<pre><code>    The superintendent or designee shall ensure that notices of FMLA provisions and
    information on procedures for filing complaints are posted in places that are readily
    accessible to employees and applicants.
</code></pre>
<p>Q.      RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520                                               Page 8 of 9
        The personnel department shall maintain records of the following information for at least
        three years: basic payroll and identifying employee data, dates (or hours) of FMLA leave
        taken by each employee, and premium payments of employee benefits. Medical
        information, such as that relating to medical certifications, also will be maintained in the
        personnel department in confidential medical records.</p>
<pre><code>    The director of human resources or designee will maintain for at least three years copies
    of employee notices, including general and specific notices, any other documents
    describing employee benefits or policies, and records of disputes between the school
    system and any employee regarding designation of FMLA leave.
</code></pre>
<p>R.      ENFORCEMENT</p>
<pre><code>    An employee may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or bring a private
    lawsuit against the school system for violations of the FMLA.

    FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination or supersede
    any state or local law that provides greater family or medical leave rights.
</code></pre>
<p>S.      OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT/FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS</p>
<pre><code>    The school system may deny FMLA benefits to an employee who engages in self-
    employment or employment for any employer while on continuous leave if the employee
    fraudulently obtained FMLA leave. Falsification of records and failure to correct records
    known to be false are violations of this policy and will result in discipline, which may
    include termination from employment.
