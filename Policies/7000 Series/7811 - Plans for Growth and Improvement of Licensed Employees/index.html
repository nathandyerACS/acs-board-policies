<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 7811</p>
<p>PLANS FOR GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT
OF LICENSED EMPLOYEES                                                 Policy Code:          7811</p>
<p>The Avery County Board of Education expects all professionally licensed employees to maintain
high levels of performance. If an employee does not meet this standard, the superintendent and
administrative staff shall address any identified performance or other deficiencies through
appropriate means, including placing the employee on a monitored growth, directed growth, or
mandatory improvement plan when required by state law, State Board policy or this policy, or
when otherwise deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Growth and mandatory improvement plans as defined by law and this policy are valuable tools to
promote the professional development of licensed employees. The board recognizes, however,
that not all conduct and performance issues require the development of a plan. Administrators
and supervisory personnel are authorized to address inappropriate conduct and/or inadequate
performance using such other lawful means as they may deem appropriate. This policy shall not
be interpreted to limit in any way the authority of administrators or other supervisory personnel
to direct and reprimand licensed employees for inappropriate conduct or inadequate
performance.</p>
<p>The superintendent shall develop procedures in accordance with state law, State Board
guidelines, and this policy as necessary to carry out the board’s directives.</p>
<p>A.     DEFINITIONS</p>
<pre><code>   1.     As used in this policy, “teacher” means an individual defined as a teacher in G.S.
          115C-325(a)(6) (for career status teachers) or G.S. 115C-325.1(6) (for non-career
          status teachers).

   2.     As used in this policy, “licensed employee(s)” includes school administrators as
          defined in G.S. 115C-325.1(5) and teachers.
</code></pre>
<p>B.     INDIVIDUAL, MONITORED, AND DIRECTED GROWTH PLANS</p>
<pre><code>   1.     Use of Growth Plans

          a.      Teachers

                  Teachers who receive an overall rating of at least “proficient” on all
                  standards on the North Carolina Teacher Evaluation Rubric as indicated
                  on the Teacher Summary Rating Form shall develop an individual growth
</code></pre>
<p>BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL                                                     Page 1 of 7
                                                                  Policy Code:         7811</p>
<pre><code>              plan designed to improve performance on specifically identified standards
              and elements.

              A teacher who is performing below a proficient level on the Teacher
              Summary Rating Form shall be placed on a monitored growth plan or a
              directed growth plan unless dismissal, demotion, nonrenewal, or
              placement on a mandatory improvement plan (see Section C, below) is
              warranted. A monitored growth plan developed in accordance with State
              Board policy is required for a teacher who is rated “developing” on one or
              more standards of the North Carolina Teacher Evaluation Rubric. State
              Board policy also requires that a teacher who is rated “not demonstrated”
              on any standard or who is rated “developing” on any standard for two
              sequential years be placed on a directed growth plan. The superintendent
              may establish other criteria that will be deemed evidence that performance
              is below a proficient level or otherwise represents unsatisfactory or below
              standard performance and warrants placement on either a monitored
              growth plan or a directed growth plan.

              Unless otherwise limited by state law or State Board policy, the principal
              is authorized to place a teacher on a monitored or directed growth plan or
              other plan of improvement at any point during the school year if the
              principal determines that the teacher is performing below the expected
              level.

       b.     School Administrators

              Professional growth plans will be developed for school administrators as
              provided in State Board policy. A professional growth plan will include
              mutually agreed upon performance goals and recommendations based
              upon the school administrator’s self-assessment, the consolidated
              assessment and the summary evaluation using the North Carolina School
              Executive; Principal and Assistant Principal Evaluation Process.
              Development of the professional growth plan will be discussed at a
              meeting between the school administrator and the superintendent or
              designee when completing the annual evaluation process.

The superintendent may move to dismiss or demote a licensed employee whether or not
the employee has been first placed on a growth or other improvement plan. See policy
7930, Professional Employees: Demotion and Dismissal.

2.     Components of Growth Plans

       Individual growth plans may contain, but are not limited to, any of the
       components listed below. However, monitored or directed growth plans must
       include at least the following components.

<p>BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL                                                 Page 2 of 7
                                                                 Policy Code:         7811</p>
<pre><code>     a.     Identification of Deficiencies

            All performance deficiencies, including all specific standards and
            elements of the Teacher Evaluation Rubric identified for improvement
            during the teacher’s evaluation, must be identified and addressed in the
            growth plan.

     b.     Performance Expectations and Goals

            For each problem identified, the growth plan must include a statement of
            the expected level of performance and/or other goals to be accomplished.

     c.     Strategies

            The growth plan must set forth a strategy or strategies designed to correct
            each identified deficiency. The strategies should be specific and clearly
            state the activities the teacher should undertake to achieve the expected
            level of performance. The strategies also should identify all individuals
            responsible for implementing the plan.

     d.     Dates for Monitoring and Completion

            The growth plan must include dates upon which the teacher’s progress
            under the plan will be reviewed and the date by which performance is to
            be improved to the expected level. Under a monitored growth plan, the
            teacher must achieve proficiency within one school year. A directed
            growth plan may provide for a shorter period to achieve proficiency, not to
            exceed one school year.

3.   Review of Growth Plans

     Individual and professional growth plans should be reviewed at least annually
     with the licensed employee’s supervisor and/or the principal, the superintendent,
     or their designees, as applicable.

     In the case of a teacher’s monitored or directed growth plan, once the designated
     time period for completion of a plan has elapsed, the principal or supervisor shall
     review the teacher’s performance, including the results of any subsequent
     evaluation and determine whether the teacher continues to perform below the
     expected level in any area or whether the teacher’s performance has improved
     sufficiently. If the teacher’s performance remains below proficient, the principal
     or supervisor shall recommend to the superintendent one of the following:

     a.     the board dismiss the teacher or demote or transfer the teacher to a

<p>C.   MANDATORY IMPROVEMENT PLANS</p>
<pre><code> A mandatory improvement plan is an instrument designed to improve a licensed
 employee’s performance by providing the employee with notice of specific performance
 areas that have substantial deficiencies and a set of strategies, including the specific
 support to be provided to the employee, so that he or she may satisfactorily resolve such
 deficiencies within a reasonable timeframe.

 The use of mandatory improvement plans as provided in this policy is discretionary and
 will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Nothing in this policy will be interpreted so
 as to require the use of mandatory improvement plans in addition to, or in lieu of, growth
 plans or other disciplinary action, including dismissal from employment as provided by
 law.

 1.     Initiating a Mandatory Improvement Plan

        a.      Licensed Employees in Low-Performing Schools

                If a licensed employee in a low-performing school receives a rating on any
                standard on an evaluation that is below proficient or otherwise represents
                unsatisfactory or below standard performance in an area that the licensed
                employee was expected to demonstrate, the individual or team that
                conducted the evaluation shall recommend to the superintendent that (i)
                the employee receive a mandatory improvement plan designed to improve
                the employee’s performance or (ii) the superintendent recommend to the
                board that the employee be dismissed or demoted. If the individual or
                team that conducted the evaluation elects not to make either of the above
                recommendations, the said individual or team shall notify the
                superintendent of this decision. The superintendent shall determine
                whether to develop a mandatory improvement plan or to recommend a
                dismissal proceeding.

                                                               Policy Code:          7811</p>
<pre><code>     b.    Teachers in Schools Not Identified as Low-Performing

           If, in an observation report or year-end evaluation, a teacher in a school
           not identified as low-performing receives a rating that is below proficient
           or otherwise represents unsatisfactory or below standard performance on
           any standard that the teacher was expected to demonstrate, the principal
           may place the employee on a mandatory improvement plan. The
           mandatory improvement plan will be utilized only if the superintendent or
           designee determines that an individual, monitored or directed growth plan
           would not satisfactorily address the deficiencies.

     c.    Any Licensed Employees Engaging in Inappropriate Conduct or
           Performance

           A principal may recommend to the superintendent or designee that a
           licensed employee be placed immediately on a mandatory improvement
           plan if the employee engages in inappropriate conduct or performs
           inadequately to such a degree that the conduct or performance causes
           substantial harm to the educational environment, but immediate dismissal
           or demotion of the employee is not appropriate. The principal must
           document the exigent reason for immediately instituting such a plan.

2.   Components of the Plan

     A mandatory improvement plan for any licensed employee must include the
     following components.

     a.    Identification of Deficiencies

           The performance areas in which the employee is deficient must be
           identified and addressed in the mandatory improvement plan.

     b.    Performance Expectations

           For each problem identified, the plan must include a statement of the
           expected level of performance.

     c.    Strategies

           The plan must establish a strategy or strategies designed to correct each
           identified deficiency. The strategies should be specific and clearly state
           the activities the employee should undertake to achieve the expected level
           of performance and the specific support to be provided to the employee.
           The strategies also should identify all individuals responsible for
           implementing the plan.

<pre><code>     d.    Dates for Monitoring and Completion

           The plan must include dates upon which the employee’s progress under
           the plan will be reviewed and the date by which performance is to be
           improved to the expected level.

3.   Development and Implementation of the Plan

     a.    Licensed Employees in Low-Performing Schools

           When directed by the superintendent, a mandatory improvement plan to
           improve the performance of a licensed employee will be developed by the
           person who evaluated the licensed employee or the employee’s supervisor,
           unless the evaluation was conducted by an assistance team. If the
           evaluation was conducted by an assistance team, that team shall develop
           the mandatory improvement plan in collaboration with the employee’s
           supervisor. Mandatory improvement plans will be designed to be
           completed within 90 instructional days or before the beginning of the next
           school year.

     b.    Teachers in Schools Not Identified As Low-Performing

           When a principal decides to put a teacher on a mandatory improvement
           plan, the principal shall develop the plan in consultation with the teacher.
           The teacher shall have five instructional days after receiving the plan to
           request a modification to the plan before it is implemented. The principal
           must consider the requested modification before finalizing the plan. The
           teacher shall have at least 60 instructional days to complete the mandatory
           improvement plan.

           A teacher has five workdays after finalization of the mandatory
           improvement plan within which to submit a request to the principal for a
           qualified observer, as defined in G.S. 115C-333.1(c)(1), to observe the
           teacher in the area or areas of concern identified in the plan. In
           accordance with G.S. 115C-333.1(c)(2), the board will create and maintain
           a list of qualified observers who are employed by the board and available
           to conduct observations. The board will strive to limit the list to
           administrators and teachers who have excellent reputations for
           competence and fairness. Selection of the qualified observer and
           submission of the qualified observer’s report to the principal will be in
           accordance with G.S. 115C-333.1(c)(3).

4.   Reassessment

     a.    Licensed Employees in Low-Performing Schools

<pre><code>                  After the expiration of the time period for the mandatory improvement
                  plan, the superintendent or designee or the assistance team shall assess the
                  employee’s performance. If the assessor determines that the employee has
                  failed to become proficient in any of the performance standards articulated
                  in the mandatory improvement plan or to demonstrate sufficient
                  improvement toward such standards, the superintendent shall recommend
                  that the employee be dismissed or demoted under applicable state law.

           b.     Teachers in Schools Not Identified As Low-Performing

                  Upon completion of a mandatory improvement plan, the principal or
                  supervisor shall assess the performance of the employee. For teachers, the
                  principal shall also review and consider any report provided by the
                  qualified observer if one has been submitted before the end of the
                  mandatory improvement plan period. If, after the assessment of the
                  employee and consideration of any report from the qualified observer, the
                  superintendent or designee determines that the teacher has failed to
                  become proficient in any of the performance standards identified as
                  deficient in the mandatory improvement plan or demonstrate sufficient
                  improvement toward such standards, the superintendent may recommend
                  that the employee be dismissed or demoted under applicable state law.
