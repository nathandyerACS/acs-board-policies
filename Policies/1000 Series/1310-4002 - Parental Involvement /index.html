<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code 1310/4002</p>
<p>PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT</p>
<p>The Avery County Board of Education recognizes the critical role of parents in the
education of their children and in the schools. The board directs school administrators to
develop programs that will promote and support parental involvement in student learning
and achievement at school and at home and encourage successful progress toward
graduation. Each parent is encouraged to learn about the educational program, the
educational goals and objectives of the school system and his or her own child's progress.
The board also encourages parents to participate in activities designed by the schools to
involve them, such as parent conferences, in order to encourage effective communication.</p>
<p>A.      PARENT COMMUNICATION AND CONFERENCES</p>
<pre><code>    The board encourages regular contact with parents by school personnel for
    commendation as well as for notification of concerns. Principals or designees
    shall plan for periodic communication with parents. Teachers are responsible for
    scheduling conferences with parents.
    Interim Reports: Notification Concerning Class Grades
    1. All middle and high school teachers are required to send interim reports to all
        students at the mid-point of each grading period.
    2. All elementary regular classroom teachers and “teachers of record” for
        academic classes are required to send interim reports to all students. Special
        teachers (i.e. art, music, P.E., library, computer, guidance, etc.) are required to
        send interim reports if a student has had a drop in behavior or performance.
    3. If the report indicates a student has had a drop in grade or may not pass the
        grading period, then Interim Reports must be signed by the parent and
        returned to the teacher. If the teacher does not receive the signed document
        from the parent, it is the teacher’s responsibility to call or meet with the parent
        and document that conversation.
    4. Teachers may offer rewards (such as a point added to a final average) for the
        student returning the interim report. However, punishment may not be used.

    Notification Concerning Repeating a Grade or a Course
    If any student is not making satisfactory progress toward promotion or passing the
    End-of Grade/End-of-Course exam, parents must be notified at the mid-year
    (elementary and middle school) or mid-semester (high school).                This
    communication must be confirmed by signature of the parent, and/or documented
    meetings.

    Notification Concerning High School Graduation
    If a student may not graduate on time, parents must be notified in person or by
    certified mail by mid-semester, or as soon as a teacher becomes aware of the
    problem. The principal or designee shall strive, through oral or written
    communication or other means, to include the parents of students identified as at-
    risk in the implementation and review of academic and/or behavioral
</code></pre>

        interventions for their children, in accordance with policy 3405, Students at Risk
        of Academic Failure.The principal or designee shall provide the parent of each
        student in kindergarten, first, or second grade with written notification of the
        student’s reading progress. The notice will be provided three times a year,
        following each benchmark assessment and will include: (1) assessment results, (2)
        whether the child may not reach reading proficiency by the end of third grade; and
        (3) instructional support activities for use at home.</p>
<pre><code>    The board encourages the superintendent to work with local business leaders,
    including the local chambers of commerce, to encourage employers to adopt as
    part of their stated personnel policies time for employees who are parents or
    guardians to attend conferences with their child’s teachers.
</code></pre>
<p>B.      PARENTAL NOTIFICATION</p>
<p>Each principal or designee of a Title I school shall effectively notify parents of all
parental rights and other required information regarding Title I schools and programs, in
accordance with federal law. Parents of students in Title I schools shall receive a copy of
the system-wide Title I parent involvement policy (policy 1320/3560, Title I Parent
Involvement) and the school-wide parent involvement plan.</p>
<p>In addition, annually every building principal or designee shall effectively notify parents
of the following:</p>
<pre><code>        1. parental rights related to student records (policy 4700, Student Records);
        2. parental rights related to student surveys (policy 4720, Surveys of

        8. Student and Parent Grievance Procedure (policy 1740/4010);
        9. the dates of the system-wide and state-mandated tests that students will be
        required to take during that school year, how the results from the test will be
        used, and whether each test is required by the State Board of Education or by
        the local board;
        10. grading practices that will be followed at the school and, in the high
        school, the means for computing the grade point averages that will be used for
