<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 1740/4010</p>
<p>STUDENT AND
PARENT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>
<p>A.     OPTIONS FOR RESOLVING COMPLAINTS</p>
<pre><code>   The board strives to resolve concerns and complaints whenever possible. To this end, the
   board has provided opportunities for students and parents to express their concerns through
   processes established in board policies. Board policy 1742/5060, Responding to
   Complaints, identifies these different processes and provides a mechanism for resolving
   complaints in an informal manner.

   While the board encourages informal resolutions, the board recognizes that students and
   parents may want a more formal process for certain types of complaints or if an informal
   process was not satisfactory. This policy provides a complaint procedure that can be used as
   described below.

   Any parent or student who is unclear of the options for proceeding with a concern may
   contact the principal’s office or the superintendent’s office for further information and copies
   of all applicable board policies.
</code></pre>
<p>B.     DEFINITIONS</p>
<pre><code>   1. Days means the working days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, vacation days or
         holidays, as set forth in the school calendar. In counting days, the first day will be
         the first full working day following the receipt of the grievance. After May 1, time
         limits will consist of all weekdays (Monday - Friday) so that the matter may be
         resolved before the close of the school term or as soon thereafter as possible.

   2. Final Administrative Decision means a decision of a school employee from which no
         further appeal to a school administrator is available.

   3. Grievance means a formal complaint regarding specific decisions made by school
         personnel which alleges that such decisions have adversely affected the person
         making the complaint. A grievance includes, but is not limited to, circumstances
         such as when a student or parent believes that board policy or law has been
         misapplied, misinterpreted or violated. Any claims of discrimination on the basis of
         race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, religion, age or disability also may be
         submitted as a grievance. The term “grievance” does not include any matter for
         which the method of review is prescribed by law, for which there is a more specific
         board policy providing a process for addressing the concern, or upon which the board
         is without authority to act.

    4. Grievant means the parent or student or group of parents or students submitting the
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1740/4010                                Page 1 of 7
               grievance.</p>
<pre><code>   5. Official means the school district personnel hearing and responding to the grievant.
</code></pre>
<p>C.     TIMELINESS OF PROCESS</p>
<pre><code>   The number of days indicated at each level should be considered a maximum and every
   effort should be made to expedite the process.

   Failure by the official at any step to communicate a decision within the specified time limit
   will permit the grievant to appeal the grievance to the next step unless the official has
   notified the grievant of the delay and the reason for the delay, such as the complexity of the
   investigation or report. The official will make reasonable efforts to keep the grievant
   apprised of progress being made during any period of delay. Delays are not permitted that
   interfere with the exercise of any legal rights.

   Failure by the grievant at any step to appeal a grievance to the next step within the specified
   time limit will be considered acceptance of the decision at that step, unless the grievant has
   notified the official of a delay, the reason for the delay and the official has consented in
   writing to the delay.
</code></pre>
<p>D.     GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<pre><code>   1.      No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the board or by an employee of the school
           district against any grievant or other student or employee on account of his or her
           participation in a grievance filed and decided pursuant to this policy.

   2.      All meetings and hearings conducted pursuant to this policy will be private.

   3.      The board and school district will consider requests to hear grievances from a group
           of grievants, but the board and officials have the discretion to respond to individual
           grievants.

   4.      The grievant may have a representative, including an attorney, at any stage of the
           grievance. However, any grievant intending to be represented by legal counsel must
           notify the appropriate school official in advance so that school personnel also will
           have the opportunity to be represented by legal counsel.
</code></pre>
<p>E.     PROCESS FOR GRIEVANCE</p>
<pre><code>   1.      Reporting Grievance

           a.      Whenever a student or parent/guardian believes that he/she has been
                   adversely affected by a decision of a school employee, the student or
                   parent/guardian may file a grievance as provided in this policy.

           b.       A grievance must be filed as soon as possible but no longer than 30 days
                    after disclosure or discovery of the facts giving rise to the grievance. For a
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1740/4010                                         Page 2 of 7
                        grievance submitted after 30 days which claims a violation, misapplication
                        or misinterpretation of state or federal law, including discrimination, the
                        superintendent or designee will determine whether the grievance will be
                        investigated after considering factors such as the reason for the delay; the
                        extent of the delay; the effect of the delay on the ability of the school district
                        to investigate and respond to the complaint; and whether the investigation of
                        the complaint is necessary to meet any legal obligations. However, students
                        and parents should recognize that delays in reporting may significantly
                        impair the ability of the school district to investigate and respond effectively
                        to such complaints.</p>
<pre><code>            c.      A student who has a grievance must provide the following information in
                    writing to the principal: (1) the name of the school district employee or other
                    individual whose decision or action is at issue; (2) the specific decision(s) or
                    actions at issue; (3) any board policy, state or federal law, state or federal
                    regulation, or State Board of Education policy or procedure that the parent or
                    student believes has been misapplied, misinterpreted or violated; (4) and the
                    specific resolution desired. If there is not a specific decision at issue and no
                    concern that state or federal law has been misapplied, misinterpreted or
                    violated, then the procedure established in board policy 1742/5060,
                    Responding to Complaints, is appropriate and the principal will address the
                    concern following that board policy.

            d.      Even if the principal is the employee whose decision or action is at issue, the
                    student will submit the grievance first to the principal in order for the
                    principal to address the issue within the formal process. If, however, the
                    grievance claims that a state or federal law has been misapplied,
                    misinterpreted or violated, the student may submit the grievance directly to
                    the superintendent or the superintendent’s designee.

    2.      Investigation

            a.      The principal will schedule and hold a meeting with the student and/or parent
                    within five school days of receiving the request. The student may be
                    accompanied by a parent, legal guardian or other person who is in a position
                    of loco parentis to the student.

            b.      The principal will conduct any investigation of the facts necessary before
                    rendering a decision.

    3.      Response by Principal

            a.      The principal will provide a written response to the written grievance within
                    ten days of the meeting. The response will include the principal’s decision
                    regarding resolution of the grievance and the basis for the decision. In
                    responding, the principal cannot disclose information about other students or
                    employees that by law is considered confidential.

                b.      A copy of the grievance and the principal’s response will be filed with the
                        superintendent.</p>
<pre><code>    4.      Response by Superintendent

            a.      If the grievant is dissatisfied with the principal’s decision, the grievant may
                    appeal the decision to the superintendent. The appeal must be made in
                    writing within five days of receiving the principal’s decision.

            b.      The superintendent may review the written documents and respond or the
                    superintendent may schedule and hold a conference with the grievant and
                    principal, and any other individuals the superintendent determines to be
                    appropriate within five school days after receiving the appeal. The student
                    may be accompanied by a parent, legal guardian or other person who is in a
                    position of loco parentis to the student.

            c.      The superintendent will provide a written response within 10 days after
                    receiving the appeal. In responding, the superintendent cannot disclose
                    information about other students or employees that by law is considered
                    confidential.

    5.      Appeal to the Board

            If the grievant has alleged a violation of a specified federal or state law, federal or
            state regulation, State Board of Education policy or procedure, or local board of
            education policy or procedure, the grievant shall have a right to appeal a final
            administrative decision to the board of education (see Mandatory Appeals below). If
            a grievant has not alleged such specific violations, he/she may request a hearing
            before the board, which the board may grant at its discretion (see Discretionary
            Appeals below).

            a.      Mandatory Appeals

                    (1)     If the grievant is dissatisfied with the superintendent’s response to
                            his/her grievance and has alleged a violation of a specified federal or
                            state law, federal or state regulation, State Board of Education policy
                            or procedure or local board of education policy or procedure, the
                            grievant may appeal the decision to the board within five days of
                            receiving the superintendent's response.

                    (2)     A hearing will be conducted pursuant to board policy 2500, Hearings
                            Before the Board.

                    (3)     The board will provide a final written decision within 30 days of
                            receiving the appeal unless further investigation is necessary or the
                            hearing necessitates that more time be taken to respond.

                       (1)     If the grievant is dissatisfied with the superintendent’s response to
                               his/her grievance but has not alleged a violation of a specified federal
                               or state law, federal or state regulation, State Board of Education
                               policy or procedure or local board of education policy or procedure,
                               within five days of receiving the superintendent’s response, the
                               grievant may submit to the superintendent a written request for a
                               hearing before the board of education.</p>
<pre><code>                   (2)     If the full board will be meeting within two weeks of the request for a
                           hearing, the board will decide at that time whether to grant a hearing.
                           Otherwise, the board chair shall appoint a three-person panel to
                           review the request and determine if a hearing should be granted. The
                           panel will report the decision to the board. The board may modify
                           the decision of the panel upon majority vote at a board meeting.

                   (3)     If the board decides to grant a hearing, the hearing will be conducted
                           pursuant to board policy 2500, Hearings Before the Board.

                   (4)     The board will provide a final written decision within 30 days of the
                           decision to grant a hearing, unless further investigation is necessary
                           or the hearing necessitates that more time be taken to respond.

<p>F.     SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES</p>
<pre><code>   1.      Discrimination on the Basis of Sex

           Sexual harassment complaint procedures are established in board policy 1745/4027.
           For other complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex, if the grievant is
           dissatisfied with the principal’s written response, the grievance may be appealed to
           the Title IX coordinator. The Title IX coordinator will review the written documents
           and may conduct any factual inquiry and hold a conference as necessary to make a
           determination of whether there was discrimination on the basis of sex. The Title IX
           coordinator will provide a written response within 10 days of receiving the grievance
           unless additional time is necessary to complete any investigation. If the corrective
           steps involve actions outside of the scope of the Title IX coordinator’s
           responsibilities, the superintendent or designee also will be notified so that
           responsibility for the corrective steps can be delegated to the appropriate individual.
           If still not satisfied, the student may appeal the Title IX coordinator's response to the
           superintendent and board as provided in this policy.                 (See also policy
           1710/4021/7230 as it relates to the Title IX coordinator.)

   2.      Discrimination on the Basis of Disability

            If the student alleged discrimination on the basis of a handicapping condition or
            disability and the student is dissatisfied with the principal’s written response, the
            grievance may then be appealed to the Section 504/Americans With Disabilities Act
            (“504/ADA”) coordinator. The 504/ADA coordinator will review the written

<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1740/4010                                      Page 5 of 7
                documents and may conduct any factual inquiry and hold a conference as necessary
                to make a determination of whether there was a discrimination on the basis of
                disability. The 504/ADA coordinator will provide a written response within 10 days
                of receiving the grievance unless additional time is necessary to complete any
                investigation. If the corrective steps involve actions outside the scope of the
                504/ADA coordinator's responsibilities, the superintendent or designee also will be
                notified so that responsibility for the corrective steps can be delegated to the
                appropriate individual. If still not satisfied, the student may appeal the 504/ADA
                coordinator’s response to the superintendent and board as provided in this policy.
                (See also policy 1710/4021/7230 as it relates to the 504/ADA coordinator.)</p>
<pre><code>    3.      Appeal of Superintendent’s Decision

            If a student wants to initiate a formal grievance in regard to a certain decision made
            by the superintendent that directly and specifically affects the student, the general
            process described in this policy will be used except the grievance will be submitted
            to the Director of Human Resources, who shall forward the grievance to the board
            chairperson.
</code></pre>
<p>G.      RECORDS</p>
<pre><code>    Records of discrimination complaints will be maintained as required by 1710/4021/7230.
</code></pre>
<p>H.      NOTICE</p>
