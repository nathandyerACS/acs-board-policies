<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 4353</p>
<p>LONG-TERM SUSPENSION,
365 DAYS SUSPENSION, EXPULSION</p>
<p>A.      DEFINITIONS</p>
<pre><code>    1.   Superintendent
         For purposes of this policy, superintendent includes the superintendent and the
         superintendent’s designee.
    2.   Principal
         For purposes of this policy, principal includes the principal and the principal’s designee.
    3.   Long-Term Suspension
         A long-term suspension is the disciplinary exclusion of a student from attending his or her
         assigned school for more than 10 school days. Disciplinary reassignment of a student to a
         full-time educational program that meets the academic requirements of the standard course of
         study established by the State Board of Education and that provides the students with the
         opportunity to make timely progress toward graduation and grade promotion is not a long-
         term suspension requiring the due process procedures set out in this policy, nor is an absence
         under G.S. 130A-440 (for failure to submit a school assessment form within 30 days of
         entering school).

         Upon the recommendation of the principal, the superintendent may impose a long-term
         suspension on a student who willfully engages in a serious violation of the code of Student
         Conduct and the violation either (1) threatens the safety of students, staff or school visitors, or
         (2) threatens to substantially disrupt the educational environment. The principal may
         recommend long-term suspension for a minor violation if aggravating circumstances justify
         treating the student’s behavior as a serious violation.

         If the offense leading to the long-term suspension occurred before the final quarter of the
         school year, the exclusion must be no longer than the remainder of the school year in which
         the offense was committed. If the offense leading to the long-term suspension occurred
         during the final quarter of the school year, the exclusion may include a period up to the
         remainder of the school year in which the offense was committed and the first semester of the
         following school year.

    4.   365-Day Suspension
          A 365 day suspension is the disciplinary exclusion of a student from attending his or her
         assigned school for 365 days. The superintendent may impose a 365-day suspension only for
         certain firearm and destructive violations, as defined in board policy 4333, Weapons, Bomb
         Threats, Terrorist Threats and Clear Threats to Safety.

    5.   Expulsion
         An expulsion is the indefinite exclusion of a student from school enrollment for disciplinary
         purposes. Upon recommendation of the superintendent, the board may expel a student who is
         14 years of age or older for certain types of misbehavior as provided in policy 4325, Drugs
         and Alcohol, policy 4330, Theft, Trespass and Damage to Property, policy 4331, Assaults,
         Threats and Harassment, and policy 4333, Weapons, Bomb Threats, Terrorist Threats and
         Clear Threats to Safety, if the student’s continued presence in school constitutes a clear threat
         to the safety of other students or employees. Additionally, a student who is subject to policy
         4260, Student Sex Offenders, may be expelled if the student’s continued presence in school
         constitutes a clear threat to the safety of other students or employees. During the expulsion,
         the student is not entitled to be present on educational property and is not considered a student
         of the school system.

<p>B.      DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE CONSEQUENCE</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4353
1.      Principal’s Recommendation</p>
<pre><code>    The principal may impose a short-term suspension or any other consequence that is consistent
    with board policies 4351 (Short-Term Suspension) and 4302 (School Plan for Management of
    Student Behavior), and the Student Code of Conduct. If the principal determines that a suspension
    of more than 10 days (either long-term or 365-day) or an expulsion is an appropriate consequence,
    the principal shall propose the disciplinary penalty based upon a review of the student’s
    culpability and dangerousness and the harm caused by the student, plus any other mitigating or
    aggravating factors the principal finds relevant.

          a. Culpability of Student – In assessing the culpability of the student for his or her behavior,
             the principal my consider criteria such as:

             1)      the student’s age;
             2)      the student’s ability to form the intent to cause harm that occurred or could have
             occurred;
             3)      evidence of the student’s intent when engaging in the conduct.

          b. Dangerousness of the Student – In assessing the dangerousness of the student the
             principal may consider criteria such as:

             1) the student’s discipline record or criminal record related to anti-social behavior or
                drugs and alcohol;

             2)        whether weapons were involved in the incident and whether the student had the
             ability to inflict serious injury or death with the weapon(s);

             3)      evidence of the student's ability to cause the harm that was intended or that
             occurred; and
             4)      whether the student is subject to policy 4260, Student Sex Offenders.

           c. Harm Caused by the Student – In assessing the severity of harm caused by the student,
    the principal may consider criteria such as whether any of the following occurred:

             1)       someone was physically injured or killed;
             2)       someone was directly threatened or property was extorted through the use of
                      a weapon;
             3)       someone was directly harmed, either emotionally or psychologically;
             4)       educational property or personal property of others was damaged; or
             5)       students, school employees or parents were aware of the presence of a weapon
             or of dangerous behavior on the part of the perpetrator.

    After considering the above factors, the principal shall make a recommendation to the
    superintendent, stating the nature of the offense, the substance of the evidence involved, and the
    length of suspension recommended.            The principal also must consider and make a
    recommendation as to whether any alternative education services, counseling or other programs
    should be part of the consequence for violating board policy, the Code of Student Conduct, school
    standards and/or school rules.

    If the principal recommends a 365-day suspension, he or she must identify the type of firearm or
    destructive device involved and the evidence substantiating that the student brought it to school
    grounds or to a school activity or possessed it on school grounds or at a school activity.

    If expulsion is recommended, the principal shall identify the basis for determining that there is
    clear and convincing evidence that the student’s continued presence in school constitutes a clear
    threat to the safety of other students or employees.

<ol>
<li>Notice to the Student’s Parent</li>
</ol>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4353
        The principal must provide the student's parent or guardian written notice of the
        recommendation for long-term suspension, 365-day suspension or expulsion by the end of the
        workday during which the long-term suspension or expulsion is recommended when reasonably
        possible or as soon thereafter as practicable. The notice must be written in plain English and, when
        appropriate language resources are readily available, also in the parent’s native language. The
        notice must contain the following ten elements:
        a. the notice type, i.e., notice of long-term suspension, 365-day suspension or expulsion,
        b. a description of the incident and the student’s conduct that led to the recommendation;
        c. the specific provisions of the student conduct policy or rule that the student allegedly violated;
        d. the specific process by which the parent or guardian may request a hearing to contest the
        decision and the deadline for making the request;
        e. the process by which the hearing will be held, including all due process rights to be accorded the
        student during the hearing;
        f. notice of the right to retain an attorney to represent the student in the hearing process;

<li>Superintendent’s Decision<pre><code>The student or his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) may request a hearing before the superintendent
or designee within three days of receipt of notice from the principal regarding the recommendation
for long-term suspension, 365-day suspension, or expulsion. Any hearing held will follow the
hearing procedures outlined in Section A of policy 4370, Student Discipline Hearing Procedures.
A decision will be rendered before the long-term suspension is imposed.

If the student or parent/guardian makes a timely request for a hearing, the superintendent shall
confirm that the charges against the student, if substantiated, could warrant the recommended
disciplinary action and shall give the student and parent reasonable notice of the time and place of
the hearing.

If neither the student nor the parent/guardian appears for a scheduled hearing after being given
reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing, the student and parent are deemed to have
waived the right to a hearing.

If the student and parent/guardian fail to make a timely request for a hearing or if they waive the
right to a hearing by failing to appear for a duly scheduled hearing, the superintendent shall review
the circumstances of the recommended long-term suspension. Following this review, the
superintendent (1) may impose the long-term or 365-day suspension if it is consistent with board
policies and appropriate under the circumstances, (2) may impose another appropriate penalty
authorized by board policy or 3) may decline to impose any penalty.

If the student or parent/guardian requests a postponement of the hearing, or if the request for the
hearing is untimely, the hearing will be rescheduled, but the student does not have the right to
return to school pending the hearing.

Based upon substantial evidence presented at the hearing, the superintendent shall decide whether
to uphold, modify or reject the principal’s recommendation.

The superintendent or designee shall immediately inform the principal of his or her decision with
regard to the recommended disciplinary penalty of a long-term or 365-day suspension and, when

        applicable, of any modifications to the penalty recommended by the principal. The superintendent
        shall send notice of the decision via certified mail to the student’s parent or guardian. The notice
        must include: (1) the basis of the decision, with reference to any policies or rules that the student
        violated; (2) notice of what information will be included in the student’s official record pursuant to
        G.S. 115C-402; (3) notice of the student’s right to appeal the decision and the procedures for such
        appeal; (4) if the decision is to suspend the student for 365 days, notice of the student’s right to
        petition the board for readmission under G.S. 115C-390.12; (5) if applicable, notice that the
        superintendent is recommending to the board that the student be expelled and any required
        notifications related to the expulsion if the student did not already receive such notice from the
        principal or designee; and (6) if the student is to be suspended, notice of the superintendent’s
        decision on whether to offer alternative education services to the student during the period of
        suspension, and, as applicable, a description of the services to be offered or the reason justifying
        the superintendent’s or designee’s decision to deny such services.</p>
<pre><code>    Following issuance of the decision, the superintendent shall implement the decision by authorizing
    the student’s return to school upon the completion of any short-term suspension or by imposing
    the suspension reflected in the decision.

    The superintendent shall offer alternative education services to any student who receives a long-
    term of 365-day suspension unless the superintendent provides a significant or important reason
    for declining to offer such services. Alternative education services are part-time or full-time
    programs that provide direct or computer-based instruction to allow the student to progress in one
    or more core academic courses. Such services may include programs described in policy
    3470/4305 Alternative Learning Programs/Schools.

    The student may appeal to the board the superintendent’s decision not to provide alternative
    education services, as permitted by G.S. 115C-4(c)(1). Any appeal to the board must be made in
    writing within five days of receiving the superintendent’s decision. The superintendent shall
    inform the board chairperson of the request for an appeal and arrange in a timely manner a hearing
    before the board. In advance of the hearing, the superintendent shall provide to the student and
    parent and to the board, a written explanation for the denial of services along with any documents
    or other information supporting the decision. The hearing will be conducted pursuant to policy
    2500 Hearings Before the Board. The board will provide to the student and parent and to the
    superintendent written notice of its decision within 30 days of receiving the appeal.

    If the superintendent determines that expulsion is appropriate, the superintendent shall submit to
    the board a recommendation and the basis for the recommendation along with any proposal for the
    alternative education services.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Hearings Before the Board<pre><code>a.   Long-Term or 365-day suspensions:

A student or his or her parent or guardian may appeal an imposed long-term or 365-day
suspension. The student or his or her parent or guardian must appeal to the board in writing within
three days of receiving the superintendent's decision. The superintendent shall inform the board
chairperson of the request for an appeal and arrange in a timely manner a hearing before the board.
The suspension need not be postponed pending the outcome of the appeal. The hearing will be
conducted pursuant to Section B of policy 4370, Student Discipline Hearing Procedures. The
board will provide to the student and parent/guardian and to the superintendent written notice of
its decision not more than 30 calendar days after receiving the appeal.

b.   For Expulsions:

The student or his or her parent or guardian may request a hearing within five days of receiving
notice that the superintendent is recommending that the student be expelled. The hearing will be
scheduled with the board within five days of the superintendent’s receipt of the hearing request.
The superintendent or designee shall notify the parent or guardian of the date, time and place of
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4353
        the hearing. Any appeal of a long-term suspension or 365-day suspension will be addressed in the
        same hearing. The hearing will be conducted pursuant to Section B of policy 4370, Student
        Discipline Hearing Procedures.</p>
<pre><code>    If a hearing is not requested by the parent, guardian or student, the superintendent will then submit
    written evidence to support the recommendation to the board. The board may elect to request a
    hearing or request additional records and documents.

    When the board decides to expel a student, the board will document the basis for the board’s
    determination that there is clear and convincing evidence that the student’s behavior indicates that
    the student’s continued presence in school constitutes a clear threat to the safety of other students
    or employees. The board also will consider and make a written determination of whether
    alternative educational services are to be provided for any expelled student. Regardless of
    whether alternative educational services are provided by the school system, the board expects the
    school district to work with other agencies to help the student and parent/guardian identify other
    types of services that may be of assistance to the student. The superintendent or designee shall
    send via certified mail to the student’s parent or guardian a copy of the decision, notification about
    what information shall be included in the student’s official record, and the procedure for
    expungement of this information under G.S. 115C-402, and notice of the right to petition for
    readmission pursuant to G.S. 115C-390.12.
</code></pre>
<p>c.   Educational Services for Students with Disabilities During Long-Term Suspension, 365-Day
     Suspension or Expulsion</p>
<pre><code>    Students with disabilities recognized by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act shall
    receive alternative educational services during periods of suspension or expulsion to the extent
    required by Policies Governing Services for Children with Disabilities and state and federal law.
</code></pre>
<p>d. Reducing Suspension and Expulsion Rates
         Though the board believes that suspension or expulsion may be an appropriate and necessary
consequence in certain situations, the board also recognizes that excessive use of suspension and expulsion
may have a negative impact on academic achievement and graduation rates. Thus, the board encourages
school administrators to find ways to reduce suspension and expulsion rates in schools.</p>
