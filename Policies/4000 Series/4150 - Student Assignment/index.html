<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 4150</p>
<p>STUDENT ASSIGNMENT</p>
<p>Student Assignment
It is the duty of the Avery County Board of Education to establish school districts within
Avery County without bias or prejudice. Students living within the school district
boundaries are automatically assigned to that school. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this policy, the superintendent shall (1) assign homeless students in a manner consistent
with state and federal law and policy 4125, Homeless Students; and (2) assign students in
foster care to their school of origin unless contrary to their best interest, as required by
federal law.</p>
<p>Students who are participating in or whose parent is participating in the North Carolina
Address Confidentiality Program established by G.S. Chapter 15C will be assigned on the
basis of their actual address, but such address will remain confidential in accordance with
las and policy 4250/5075/7316, North Carolina Address Confidentiality Program.</p>
<p>Out-of-District / Within County Applications
Students desiring to attend a school out-of-district within Avery County must make
application and be approved by the Superintendent and must be done prior to the
beginning of school in August.</p>
<p>The following will be the basis for in-county transfers:</p>
<pre><code>1. No transfer shall cause the reorganization of the school receiving an out-of-
   district student.
2. Students granted a transfer shall comply fully with school schedule regulations
   and should be regular in attendance without being tardy to school. Failure to do so
   shall be grounds to terminate the transfer.
3. Students must have no more than 10 excused/unexcused absences from their
   assigned school unless granted prior approval from school administration.
4. Transfer requests shall be considered based on the educational needs and best
   interests of the student.
5. The parent shall be responsible for transportation to and from school (except for
   homeless student transfers and transfers of students in foster care based on the
   student’s best interest, for which the system will provide transportation in a
   manner consistent with legal requirements and policy 4125).
6. The transfer will be for the duration of time that the student is enrolled in the
   school he/she transfers.
7. Principals have the authority to revisit a student’s application at any time if the
   student has poor attendance or discipline issues. The student will be reassigned to
   his/her home district.
8. If the application for reassignment is disapproved, the board will give notice to
   the applicant by registered or certified mail.

<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4150                                            Page 1 of 4
Exceptions to this policy include limited English proficient (LEP) identified and served
students who have been placed in the school by the LEP Coordinator and special
education identified and served students who have been placed in the school by the
Director of Children with Special Needs. Appeals may be made to the Avery County
Board of Education in compliance with G.S. 115C-369.</p>
<p>Transfer of Students During the School Year</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Change of Residence</p>
<pre><code>Students whose legal residence changes from one school assignment area to
another within the school system during the same school year may choose to
finish out that school year in the same school or attend school in the area to which
they have moved. If they elect to remain in the first school in order to complete
that year, they will be assigned to the school according to the area in which they
live at the beginning of the next school year. Students whose legal residence has
changed but who choose to complete the school year at their first school will be
responsible for their own transportation to school.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unsafe School Choice Transfer under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act</p>
<pre><code>Transfers for students who are victims of violent criminal offenses at school or for
students attending persistently dangerous schools as defined by State Board of
Education policy will be made pursuant to policy 4152, Unsafe School Choice
Transfer. The length of the transfer or reassignment will be consistent with legal
requirements and policy 4152.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer of Homeless Students</p>
<pre><code>Students who become homeless between academic years or during an academic
year may request to remain at the school of origin for the duration of their
homelessness or may request to be enrolled in any public school that other
students living on the same attendance area are eligible to attend. Any decision
about the transfer or reassignment of a homeless student, as well as the length of
the transfer or reassignment, will be consistent with legal requirements and based
on the student’s best interest. (See policy 4125, Homeless Students.)
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.Transfer of Students in Foster Care</p>
<pre><code>    Students who are assigned to foster care between academic years or during an
    academic year will remain in their school of origin unless remaining in the school
    of origin is not in the best interest of the student. The best interest of the student
    will be decided based on all relevant factors, including consideration of the
    appropriateness of the educational setting and proximity to the school in which
    the child is enrolled at the time of placement in foster care. The length of the
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4150                                             Page 2 of 4
        transfer or the reassignment of students in foster care will be consistent with legal
        requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Other Transfers<pre><code>The superintendent shall consider student requests for transfer to another school
during the school year based upon space availability, the needs of the child, the
effect on the school to which transfer is requested, principal recommendations,
and other criteria established by the superintendent.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Approved applications need only be submitted once for both out-of-district and out-of-
county while attending each particular grade span (elementary, middle and high). For
example: an approved application for out of district elementary school need not be
resubmitted until the student reaches middle school. At that time, the application must be
made to attend a middle school that is out of the student’s home district.</p>
<p>Any transfer request that is approved based on false or misleading information will be
declared void, and the transfer will be rescinded.</p>
<ol>
<li>Assignment to Alternative School<pre><code>Students will be assigned to the alternative school in accordance with policy
3470/4305, Alternative Learning Programs/Schools.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Release to Attend Out of Avery County
Students living in Avery County and desiring to attend school in another county must
receive a release from the Avery County Board of Education before applying to the other
school system. The application for release will be effective for the duration of the
student's educational career unless the student returns to Avery County Schools and later
wishes to be released again.</p>
<p>Criteria for Non-Resident Enrollment
Students living outside Avery County and desiring to attend school in Avery County
must receive a release from their home county before applying to Avery County Schools.
No student, neither of whose parents nor legal guardian/custodian (by Court Decree)
reside in Avery County, shall be admitted to or enrolled in the Avery County Public
Schools System unless they meet the criteria of N.C.G.S. 115C-366(a1) institution for
children such as orphanage, (a2) homeless, (b) assignment by school district board, (c)
parents in service in General Assembly or N.C.G.S. 115C-366.2 parent teaches at college
or university in district. Students who are domiciled in the counties of Burke, Caldwell,
Mitchell, and Watauga are covered by reciprocal agreements with said counties due to the
extraordinary and particular geographic and topographic barriers limiting the students'
access to their domiciliary school and are not subject to the strictures of the listed
statutes.</p>
<p>Application for Non-Resident Students</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4150                                             Page 3 of 4
Any student, neither of whose parents nor legal guardian/custodian (by Court Decree)
reside in Avery County, must make application and be approved one time to that
particular school to become enrolled in the Avery County Public School System.</p>
<p>Reciprocal Agreements
The Avery County Board of Education recognizes that, due to the particular geographic
and topographic barriers existing between Avery County and Caldwell, Mitchell, and
Watauga Counties, some students must logically cross county lines to attend the school
nearest their homes or communities. Watauga County Schools charges tuition for
students from Avery County unless the student is domiciled in the Beech Mountain
School/Buckeye Creek Community. The releasing school district and the accepting
school district must agree on placement of each student.</p>
<p>Burke County Students Attending Avery County Schools
Students residing in the Jonas Ridge area of Burke County shall, by mutual agreement of
the two systems, attend Avery County Schools. In accordance with the agreement
between Burke and Avery Counties, Burke County shall be charged and shall pay tuition
for each Burke County student attending Avery County schools. The official count shall
be taken on September 1 of each school year.</p>
