<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 4700</p>
<p>STUDENT RECORDS</p>
<p>All student records will be current and maintained with appropriate measures of security and
confidentiality. The principal is responsible for meeting all legal requirements pertaining to the
maintenance, review and release of records retained at the school.</p>
<p>A.      ANNUAL NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS</p>
<pre><code>    The superintendent or designee shall provide eligible students and parents with annual
    notification of their rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
    (FERPA). The school district does not have to individually notify parents or eligible
    students of their rights, but must provide the notice in a manner reasonably likely to
    inform the parents and eligible students of their rights. Effective notice must be provided
    to parents or eligible students who are disabled or whose primary or home language is not
    English. The notice must contain all information required by federal law and regulations
    including the following:


 1. the right to inspect and review the student’s educational records and the procedure for
    exercising this right;
 2. the right to request amendment of the student’s educational records that the parent or
    eligible student believes to be inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student’s
    privacy rights; and the procedure for exercising this right;
 3. the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the
    student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure
    without consent;
 4. the type of information designated as directory information and the right to opt out of
    release of directory information;
 5. that the school system releases records to other institutions that have requested the
    information and in which the student seeks or intends to enroll;
 6. the right to opt out of releasing the student’s name, address and phone number to military
    recruiters or institutions of higher education that request such information;
 7. a specification of the criteria for determining who constitutes a school official and what
    constitutes a legitimate educational interest if a school official discloses or intends to
    disclose personally identifiable information to school officials without consent; and
 8. notification if the school system uses contractors, consultants, volunteers, or similar
    persons as school officials to perform certain school system services and functions that it
    would otherwise perform itself; and
 9. the right to file complaints with the Family Policy Compliance Office in the U.S.
    Department of Education.

<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700
B.      Definition of Parent and Eligible Student
        1. Parent</p>
<pre><code>            For purposes of this policy, the term “parent” includes a natural parent, a guardian
            or an individual acting as a parent in the absence of a parent or guardian. If the
            parents of a student are separated or divorced, both parents have the right to
            access the student’s records as provided in this policy, unless the school system
            has been provided with evidence that there is a court order, state statute or other
            legally binding document that specifically revokes these rights.

    2.      Eligible Student

            For purposes of this policy, an eligible student is a student who has reached 18
            years of age or is attending an institution of postsecondary education. The rights
            afforded to parents under this policy transfer to an eligible student. However,
            parents may still have access to the records as long as the student is claimed as a
            dependent by the parent for federal income tax purposes. An eligible student
            wishing to prevent access to records by his or her parents must furnish to the
            principal information verifying that the student is not a dependent of his or her
            parents. If a parent of a student who is at least 18 and no longer attending a
            school within the system wishes to inspect and review the student’s records, he or
            she must provide information verifying that the student is a dependent for federal
            income tax purposes.

            A student under age 18 may have access to student records only upon the consent
            of his or her parents.
</code></pre>
<p>C.      CLASSIFICATION AND MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
              Information about students that is collected and stored by school personnel may
              be separated into several categories including, but not limited to, the following
              records.</p>
<pre><code>    1. Cumulative Records

         The cumulative record is the official record for each student. The cumulative record
         includes student identification information, such as the student’s name, address, or a
         homeless student’s living situation, sex, race, birthplace and birth date; family data
         including the parents’ names, addresses, work and home telephone numbers, and
         places of employment grades; standardized test scores; health screenings and
         immunization documentation; attendance records; withdrawal and reentry records;
         discipline records; honors and activities; class rank; date of graduation; and follow up
         records.

[Type here]</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700
        2. Discipline Records</p>
<pre><code>        Student discipline records are part of the student’s official record and must be
        maintained and reviewed pursuant to policy 4345, Student Discipline Records.
        Discipline records must be expunged and forwarded pursuant to the requirements of
        law and the procedures of policy 4345.

    3. Records of Students with Disabilities

        Students with recognized disabilities must be accorded all rights in regard to their
        records as provided by state and federal law, including the Individuals with
        Disabilities Education Act and policy 3520, Special Education Programs/Rights of
        Students with Disabilities. Records for a student identified as a student with a
        disability are considered part of the student’s official records and must be maintained
        in accordance with all appropriate federal and state regulations. Access to these
        records will be restricted to personnel having specific responsibility in this area. A
        list of all approved personnel having access to these restricted files will be updated as
        needed, and a current, dated list will be posted in the student records location.

    4. Records Received form the Department of Social Services

        The Department of Social Services may disclose confidential information to the
        school system in order to protect a juvenile from abuse or neglect. Any confidential
        information disclosed under these circumstances must remain confidential and may
        only be redisclosed for purposes directly connected with carrying out the school
        system’s mandated educational responsibilities.

    5. Juvenile Records
       Juvenile records include documentation or information regarding students who are
       under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. These records may be received from local
       law enforcement and/or other local agencies authorized to share information
       concerning juveniles in accordance with G. S. 7B-3100. These records also may
       include notice from the sheriff to the board that a student has been required to register
       with the sheriff because the student has been found to be a danger to the community
       under G.S. Chapter 14, Part 4. Such documents must not be a part of a student’s
       official records but must be maintained by the principal in a safe, locked storage that
       is separate from the student’s other records. The principal shall not make a copy of
       such documents under any circumstances.

      Juvenile records will be used only to protect the safety of or to improve the
      educational opportunities for the student or others. The principal may share juvenile
      records with individuals who have (a) direct guidance, teaching or supervisory
      responsibility for the student and (b) a specific need to know in order to protect the
      safety of the student and others. Persons provided access to juvenile records must
      indicate in writing that they have read the document(s) and agree to maintain

            confidentiality of the records.</p>

                validation by the official records.</p>
<pre><code>            Simultaneous with the enrollment and conditional placement of the student,
            school administrators shall request the student’s official record from his or her
            previous school.

<p>G.      REVIEW, RELEASE OF RECORDS TO PARENT, GUARDIAN OR ELIGIBLE STUDENT
        A parent, guardian or eligible student may access the student's records upon proper
        request. The principal or guidance office personnel of the student’s school shall schedule
        an appointment as soon as possible but no later than 45 days after the request by the
        parent or eligible student. The parent or eligible student may formally review the
        student’s complete records only in the presence of the principal or a designee competent
        to explain the records. School personnel shall not destroy any educational records if
        there is an outstanding request to inspect or review the records.</p>
<pre><code>    A parent or eligible student has the right to challenge an item in the student record
    believed to be inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy
    rights. The principal shall examine a request to amend a student record item and respond
    in writing to the person who challenges the item. Subsequent steps, if necessary, will
    follow the student grievance procedures as provided in policy 1740/4010, Student and

<pre><code>   Before releasing or disclosing records as permitted by law, school officials shall use
   Reasonable methods to identify and authenticate the identity of the party to whom the
   records are disclosed.

    1. Release/Disclosure with Parental Consent

    School officials shall obtain written permission from a parent or eligible student before
    releasing or disclosing student records that contain personally identifiable information,
    except in circumstances where the school system is authorized by law to release the
    records without such permission. The written permission must specify the records to be
    released, the purpose of the release, and the party(ies) to whom they are to be released.

    2. Release/Disclosure without Parental Consent

<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700
        School system officials shall promptly release student records when a student transfers to
        another school. The records custodian may release or disclose records with personally
        identifiable information without parental permission to the extent permitted by law,
        including to other school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the
        records.</p>
<pre><code>    When personally identifiable information from a student’s records is released without
    prior written consent of the parent or eligible student, the party to whom the information
    is released must agree not to disclose the information to any other party without the prior
    consent of the parent or eligible student. This restriction does not apply to the release of
    directory information, release of information to parents of non-eligible students, release
    of information to parents of dependent students, or release of information in accordance
    with a court order or subpoena.

    The superintendent shall employ reasonable methods to ensure that teachers and other
    school officials obtain access only to those educational records in which they have
    legitimate educational interests.

    3. Release of Directory Information

    Permission of the parent or eligible student is not required for the release of information
    that is designated as directory information by the board, provided that the parent or
    eligible student has been given proper notice and an opportunity to opt out. (See policy
    1310/4002, Parental Involvement.

    a. The board designates the following student record information as directory
    information:

         1. student's name;
         2. address;
         3. parent’s/legal guardian’s name
         4. telephone listing;
         5. electric mail address;
         6. photograph;
         7. grade level;
         8. date and place of birth;
         9. participation in officially recognized activities and sports;
       10. weight and height of members of athletic team;
       11. dates of attendance;
       12. diplomas, certification and awards received; and
       13. most recent previous school or education at institution attended by the student.

<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700
        c. Information about a homeless student’s living situation is ot considered directory
        information and will not be released.</p>
<pre><code>    d. As required by law, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of secondary school
    students shall be released, upon request, to military recruiters or institutions of higher
    learning, whether or not such information is designated directory information by the
    school system. Students or their parents, however, may request that the student’s name,
    address, and telephone number not be released without prior written parental consent.
    School officials shall notify parents of the option to make a request and shall comply with
    any requests made.

    e. All requests for directory information must be submitted to the superintendent or
    designee for approval. The superintendent is directed to establish regulations regarding
    the release of directory information. At a minimum, the regulations must:

       1. specify the types of organizations that are eligible to receive directory information
    and for what purposes;

       2. provide for equal disclosure to organizations that are similar in purpose; and

       3. authorize access to directory information to recruiters of military forces of the state
    or United States for the purpose of informing students of educational and career
    opportunities available in the military to the same extent that such information is made
    available to persons or organizations that inform students of occupational or educational
    options.

       4. Records of Students with Disabilities

    Students with recognized disabilities must be accorded all rights in regard to their records
    as provided by state and federal law, including the Individuals with Disabilities
    Education Act.

       5. Disclosure of De-Identified Information

    Education records may be released without consent of the parent or eligible student if all
    personally identifiable information has been removed. Personally identifiable information
    includes both direct and indirect identifiers that, alone or in combination, would allow a
    reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of
    the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty.

    Unless specifically permitted by law, records that have been de-identified must not be
    released without the consent of the parent or eligible student if school officials reasonably
    believe that the person requesting the information knows the identity of the student to
    whom the education record relates.

    parent or student.
</code></pre>
<p>J.     RECORD OF ACCESS AND DISCLOSURE</p>
<pre><code>    The principal or designee shall maintain a record in each student’s file indicating all
    persons who have requested or received personally identifiable information from a
    student’s record and the legitimate reason(s) for requesting or obtaining the information.

    school officials, parties seeking directory information, a party seeking or receiving the
    records under a court order or subpoena that prohibits disclosure, or those individuals
    with written parental consent.
</code></pre>

    no longer needed to provide educational services to the student or to protect the safety of
    the student or others. School officials must destroy student records if the parent or
    eligible student requests their destruction and if such records are no longer needed to
    provide educational services to the student or to protect the safety of the student or others.
    School officials shall not destroy student records if there is an outstanding request to
    inspect the particular records.
