<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 4125</p>
<p>HOMELESS STUDENTS</p>
<p>As required by the North Carolina Constitution and North Carolina law, the Avery
County Board of Education is committed to providing a free public-school education to
all children who are legally entitled to enroll in the school system. In accordance with the
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and the North Carolina State Plan for
Educating Homeless Children, the board will make reasonable efforts to identify
homeless children and youth of school age within the area served by the school system,
encourage their enrollment, and eliminate barriers to their receiving an education which
may exist in district policies or practices. Based on individual need, homeless students
will be provided services available to all students, such as preschool, free or reduced
school meals, services for English learners, special education, career and technical
education (CTE), academically or intellectually gifted (AIG) services, and before- and
after-school care.</p>
<p>The provisions of this policy will supersede any and all conflicting provisions in board
policies that address the areas discussed in this policy.</p>
<p>A.      DEFINITION OF HOMELESS STUDENTS</p>
<pre><code>    Homeless students are children and youth who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate
    nighttime residence. The term “homeless student” will also be deemed to include
    the term “unaccompanied youth” which includes a youth who is not in the
    physical custody of a parent or guardian. Homeless children and youth include
    those students who are as follows:

    1.      sharing the house of other persons due to loss of housing, economic
            hardship, or a similar reason;

    2.      living in motels, hotels, transient trailer parks, or camping grounds due to
            the lack of alternative adequate accommodations;

    3.      living in emergency or transitional shelters;

    4.      abandoned in hospitals;

    5.      living in a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not
            designed for or ordinarily used as regular sleeping accommodations for
            human beings;

    6.      living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard
            housing, bus or train stations or similar settings; or

    7.      living in a migratory situation that qualifies as homeless because the child
            lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.

B.     ENROLLMENT, ASSIGNMENT, AND TRANSPORTATION OF HOMELESS STUDENTS</p>
<pre><code>   1. Enrollment

      a.    Eligibility

            Notwithstanding the enrollment eligibility requirements established by the
            board elsewhere in policy, school personnel shall immediately enroll
            homeless students even if they do not have proof of residency, school and
            immunization records, birth certificates, or other documents; have missed
            application or enrollment deadlines during a period of homelessness; have
            outstanding fees; or are not accompanied by an adult. The homeless
            liaison shall assist the students and parents or guardians in securing
            appropriate records or otherwise meeting enrollment requirements.

      b.    Records

            Homeless students transferring into the school district may provide
            cumulative and other records directly to the school district. The school
            district will not require that such records be forwarded from another
            school district before the student may enroll. However, school personnel
            will immediately request the official records from the previous school.

            Information regarding a child or youth’s homeless situation must be
            treated as a student record and protected accordingly. See policy 4700,
            Student Records.

    2. Assignment

            A homeless student (or the student’s parent or guardian) may request to
            attend (1) his/her school of origin or (2) any public school that other
            students living in the same attendance area are eligible to attend. The
            school of origin is defined as the school the student attended before losing
            permanent housing or the school in which the student was last enrolled,
            including a preschool. When a student completes the final grade level
            served by the school of origin, the school of origin includes the designated
            receiving school at the next grade level for all feeder schools. Unless not
            in the student’s best interest, a homeless student who continues attending
            the school of origin will remain enrolled in the school of origin for the
            entire time the student is homeless and until the end of any academic year
            in which the student moves into permanent housing.

            The superintendent shall designate the Director of Student Assignment or
            other appropriate personnel to decide, in consultation with the homeless
            liaison, which school a homeless student will attend. The decision must
            be based upon consideration of student-centered factors related to the
            student’s best interests including factors concerning the impact of mobility
            on achievement, education, health, and safety of homeless students, giving
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code 4125                                            Page 2 of 10
                priority to the request of the student’s parent or guardian or the
                unaccompanied youth. The superintendent’s designee must presume that
                keeping the student in the school of origin is in the student’s best interest
                unless contradicted by the student’s parent or guardian or the
                unaccompanied youth.</p>
<pre><code>            If the superintendent’s designee determines that it is not in the student’s
            best interest to attend the school of origin to the school requested by the
            parent or guardian or unaccompanied youth he/she must provide a written
            explanation of the reasons for the determination to the parent or guardian
            or unaccompanied youth, along with information regarding the right to
            appeal the placement decision as described in Section D, below.

    3. Transportation

            The board of education will provide homeless students with transportation
            services comparable to those of other students. In addition, at the parent
            or guardian’s request (or at the request of the homeless liaison for
            unaccompanied youth), the board will provide transportation services
            to/from the school of origin. The superintendent or designee and the
            homeless liaison shall coordinate homeless students’ transportation needs,
            based on the child’s best interest. In situations in which a student attends
            school in this system but his or her temporary housing is in another system
            (or vice versa), the superintendent or designee shall work with the other
            system to share the cost and/or responsibility for transportation. If an
            agreement cannot be reached between the systems, the cost of such
            transportation will be divided evenly.

            If a homeless student becomes permanently housed and chooses to remain
            in his or her school of origin, the board will provide transportation to the
            student for the remainder of the school year.
</code></pre>
<p>C.      ELIGIBILITY FOR TITLE I SERVICES</p>
<pre><code>    Homeless students are automatically eligible for Title I services. The homeless
    liaison and the Title I director shall collaborate to identify the needs of homeless
    students.
</code></pre>
<p>D.      DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS</p>
<pre><code>    A parent, guardian, or unaccompanied youth who disagrees with a decision of
    school officials with regard to eligibility, school selection, or enrollment of a
    student who is homeless (hereinafter, referred to as a “complainant”) may appeal
    the decision to the school system’s homeless liaison in accordance with this
    section upon registering or attempting to register the child or youth at the school
    in which enrollment is sought.

    Any employee who is aware that an unaccompanied youth or a parent or guardian
    of a homeless student is dissatisfied with a decision of school officials with regard

                        principal of the school in which enrollment is sought. The appeal
                        must be presented within five school days of the decision giving
                        rise to the complaint unless the homeless liaison agrees to an
                        extension of up to five additional school days for good cause.</p>
<pre><code>                    ii. The appeal may be made orally or in writing on the designated

          b. Appeal to the Superintendent of the Liaison’s Decision

                    i. Within two school days of receiving the liaison’s decision, the
                    complainant may appeal the decision to the superintendent orally
                    or in writing using the
                       form designated for this purpose. Oral appeals must be made to
                    the homeless liaison, who shall commit the appeal to writing on the
                    designated form.

                    iii. Within four school days of receiving the appeal, the
                    superintendent or designee shall provide a written decision to the
                    complainant including a statement
                         of the reasons for the decision.

          c. Appeal to the Board of the Superintendent’s Decision

<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code 4125                                            Page 6 of 10
                        i. If the complainant is dissatisfied with the superintendent’s
                        decision, he/she may file an appeal with the board of education
                        within two days.</p>
<pre><code>                    ii. The appeal may be filed orally or in writing using the form
                    designated for this purpose. Orla appeals must be made to the
                    homeless liaison, who shall
                       commit the appeal to writing on the designated form.

                    iii. The board of a panel of at least two board members acting on
                    behalf of the boar will hear the appeal. The board or board panel
                    will provide the complainant with a
                        written decision within five school days of receiving the appeal.
                    In unusual circumstances the board or board panel may extend this
                    time but will avoid exceeding the
                        lesser of (1) 15 school days from when the complaint was
                    received or (2) 30 calendar days from when the complaint was
                    received.

                    iv. The board’s or board panels’ decision will constitute the final
                    decision of school district for purposes of the complaint’s right to
                    appeal to the State Coordinator.

                    v. If the matter under appeal is a school assignment, a board panel
                    decision will be a recommendation that must be submitted to the
                    full board for a final determination as
                       required by state law and policy 4150, School Assignment.
                    However, in order to ensure an expedited appeals process for
                    students who are homeless, the recommendation
                       of the board panel shall be considered the final decision of the
                    board for purposes of appeal to the State Coordinator if a final
                    determination by the full board reasonably
                       cannot be accomplished by the deadline described in the
                    previous paragraph.

                    vi. The written statement of the final decision will include the
                    name and contact of the State Coordinator for homeless education
                    and will describe the appeal rights to the
                       State Coordinator. If the matter under appeal is a school
                    assignment and the appeal was not heard by the full board, the
                    written decision will also note that review of
                       the matter by the full board as required by state law is pending.

         d. Appeal to the State Coordinator of the Board’s Decision

            If the complainant is dissatisfied with the decision of the board or board
            panel, he/she may file an oral or written appeal with the State Coordinator
            for homeless education within three school days of receiving the board or

                panel’s decision. The State Coordinator will issue a final decision on the
                complaint. The appeal must include:</p>
<pre><code>                       i.   the name, physical address if available, e-mail address, and
                            telephone number of the complainant;

                     iv.    the federal requirement alleged to have been violated;
                      v.    how the requirement is alleged to have been violated; and
                     vi.    the relief the person is seeking.

            Within three school days following a request from the State Coordinator,
            the homeless liaison shall provide the record of complaint, a copy of the
            board or panel’s decision, and any other supporting documents necessary
            to complete the record.
