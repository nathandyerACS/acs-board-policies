<p>Avery County Schools Policy                                                 Adopted 1-17-12
Policy Code: 3226/7321</p>
<p>REQUIRED USE POLICY</p>
<p>STUDENT REQUIRED USE AND INTERNET SAFETY POLICY (RUP)
(in accordance with Children’s Internet Protection Act [CIPA] and North Carolina Public Law
106-554)</p>
<p>PURPOSE: Avery County Schools (ACS) provides all students access to the Internet, network
resources, laptop computers or IPads at all grade levels in order to promote achievement and
provide diverse opportunities during the educational experience. This policy provides guidelines
and information about the limitations that the school imposes on use of these resources. In
addition to this policy, the use of any school computer, including laptop computers and IPads,
also requires students to abide by the ACS Technology Use Guidelines as stated in the Student
Code of Conduct. Additional rules may be added as necessary and will become a part of this
policy.</p>
<pre><code>      TERMS OF THE REQUIRED USE AND INTERNET SAFETY POLICY
</code></pre>
<p>Specifically, the student:</p>
<p>ñ Will adhere to these guidelines each time the Internet is used at school or at any time while
      using a school-owned computer or machine.</p>
<p>ñ Will make available for inspection by an administrator or teacher, upon request, any
      messages or files sent or received at any Internet location. Files and other electronic
      information accessed, stored, downloaded, or transferred on district-owned technology
      are not private and the student has no right to privacy for such content.</p>
<p>ñ Will use appropriate language in all communications avoiding profanity, obscenity, and
      offensive or inflammatory speech. Cyber-bullying and harassment, such as personal
      attacks and/or threats on/against anyone made while using district owned technology to
      access the Internet or local school networks shall be reported to responsible school
      personnel. Rules of “netiquette” should be followed by conducting oneself in a
      responsible, ethical, and polite manner.</p>
<p>ñ Will follow copyright laws and will only download/import music or other files to a district
      owned technology that he/she is authorized or legally permitted to reproduce, or for
      which he/she has the copyright.</p>
<p>ñ Will never reveal identifying information, files, or communications to others through email
      or posts to the Internet.</p>
<p>ñ Will not attempt access to networks and other technologies beyond the point of authorized
      access. This includes, but is not limited to, attempts to use another person’s account
      and/or password.</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3226/7321                                      Page 1 of 9
ñ Will not share passwords or attempt to discover passwords. Sharing a password could make
      you responsible for another’s misconduct and result in disciplinary action.</p>
<p>ñ Will not download or install malicious software or software that requires administrative or
      “root” access to install onto district-own technology.</p>
<p>ñ Will not tamper with nor attempt to alter computer hardware or software. Unauthorized entry
      into computers, vandalism or destruction of the computer or computer files may result in
      disciplinary action and/or criminal charges.</p>
<p>ñ Will not attempt to override, bypass, or otherwise change the Internet filtering software or
      other network configurations.</p>
<p>ñ Will use technology for school-related purposes only during the instructional day while
      refraining from use related to commercial, political, or other private purposes.</p>
<p>ñ Will not make use of materials or attempt to locate materials that are unacceptable in a school
      setting. Students will recognize that all Internet and electronic communication access is
      provided to ACS students for educational purposes. Personal use is acceptable as long as
      such use does not interfere with instructional use. Personal use must comply with all ACS
      policies and may not involve activities that are unethical, illegal, immoral, profane,
      obscene, or pornographic. Specifically, all district owned technologies should be free at
      all times of any pornographic, obscene, graphically violent, or vulgar images, sounds,
      music, language, video or other materials (files).</p>
<p>ñ Will not connect any personal wireless access points, routers or other network devices to the
      district owned and maintained local, wide or metro area network. Connection of personal
      devices such as iPods, smart-phones, PDAs and printers is permitted but not supported by
      ACS technical staff. Home Internet use and cost is the responsibility of the student both
      in cost and configuration. Dial-up is not an option as recent laptop configurations do
      not include modems.</p>
<p>ñ Will keep the district-issued laptop or iPad secure and damage free. Each device is issued
      with a protective shell cover and a protective sleeve. When the device is being
      transported, it must be in its sleeve and must be secured in a carrying bag.</p>
<p>ñ Will not loan your laptop or charger and cords to anyone.</p>
<p>ñ Will not leave the laptop in vehicle due to concerns of theft and temperature extremes that
      may damage the device.</p>
<p>ñ Will not leave your laptop unattended, either on school property or off school property.</p>
<p>ñ Will not eat or drink while using the laptop or have food or drinks in close proximity to the
      laptop.</p>
<p>ñ Will not allow pets near your laptop.</p>
<p>ñ Will not place the laptop on the floor or in sitting areas such as couches or chairs.</p>

ñ Will not leave the laptop near table or desk edges.</p>
<p>ñ Will not stack objects on top of your laptop.</p>
<p>ñ Will not leave the laptop outside or use near water, such as a pool.</p>
<p>ñ Will not check the laptop as luggage at the airport.</p>
<p>ñ Will back up data and other important files regularly. ACS will at times maintenance the
      laptops by imaging. All files not backed up to server storage space or other storage media
      will be deleted during these processes. Students are ultimately responsible for backing up
      all personal files.</p>
<p>ñ At the end of each school year, laptop computers will be returned to ACS for repair and
      servicing needs.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: The Avery County Board of Education or its employees will not be responsible for
any damages suffered including lack of file or e-mail privacy, a loss of data resulting from
delays, non-deliveries, or service interruptions. The Board is also not responsible for the
accuracy or quality of information obtained through the network including objectionable
materials and/or viewpoints. The user accepts personal responsibility for any information
obtained or delivered via the network, including the sharing of personal information such as
home address, checking accounts or credit card information.</p>
<p>By signing this you agree to abide by the conditions listed above and assume responsibility for
the care and proper use of ACS technology, including personally backing up personal data. ACS
is not responsible for any loss resulting from delays, non-deliveries, missed deliveries, lost data,
or service interruptions caused by user errors, omissions, or reasons beyond the district’s control.
Information obtained via the Internet and other sources using ACS technologies is not
guaranteed as to its accuracy or quality. I understand that should I fail to honor all the terms of
this Policy, future Internet and other electronic media accessibility may be denied. Furthermore, I
may be subject to disciplinary action outlined in the ACS Student Code of Conduct and, if
applicable, my laptop computer or iPad may be recalled.</p>
