Policy Code: 3225/7320</p>
<p>ACSNET ACCEPTABLE USE</p>
<p>ACSNet Board Policy
A.       Purpose Avery County Schools provides employees and students with access to the
district's electronic communication system, which includes resources such as computer
workstations and peripherals and services such as Internet access, email and online web-based
products. This system will be referred to as ACSNet.
   1. The ACSNet system has a limited educational purpose. The purpose of the ACSNet
      system is to assist in preparing students for success in life and work in the 21st century by
      providing them with electronic access to a wide range of information and the ability to
      communicate with people from throughout the world. Additionally, the system will be
      used to enhance District communication, enhance productivity, and assist District
      employees in their professional development through greater exchange of information
      with their peers. The ACSNet system will also assist the District in sharing information
      with the local community, including parents, social service agencies, government
      agencies, and businesses.
   2. Users may not use the ACSNet system for commercial purposes, defined as offering or
      providing goods or services. District acquisition policies will be followed for District
      purchase of goods or services through the ACSNet system.
   3. Users may not use the system for political activities during school hours, or for political
      activities that involve school monies or that makes use of an official school position to
      encourage or coerce students or other employees to support in any way a political party,
      candidate, or issue. District employees and students may use the system to communicate
      with their elected representatives and to express their opinion on political issues.
   4. The term "educational purpose" includes use of the system for administrative support
      activities, classroom activities, professional or career development, and limited high-
      quality self-discovery activities. For students, the limited, high-quality self-discovery
      activities must be reasonably supervised by District employees and should be directly
      related to the District’s educational objectives.
   5.    While this Policy applies to the acceptable use of ACSNet, when creating or posting
        material to a webpage or other Internet site apart from the ACSNet, employees should
        remember that the content may be viewed by anyone, including community members,
        students and parents. Employees are to maintain an appropriate relationship with
        students at all times. Having a public personal website or online networking profile or
        allowing access to a private website or private online networking profile is considered a
        form of direct communications with students. Employees are asked to block students
        from viewing any material or profiles that are not age appropriate. Any employee found
        to have created and/or posted inappropriate content on a website or profile that has a
        negative impact on the employee's ability to perform their job as it relates to working
        with students will be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal. This Policy
        applies to all employees, volunteers and student teachers working for or in the Avery
        County School System.</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3225/7320                                          Page 1 of 17

        of their parent. An agreement will only be required for an individual account, which must
        be signed by the student and his or her parent. Parents may specifically request that their

     3. The ACSNet Acceptable Use policy contains restrictions on accessing inappropriate
        material. There is a wide range of material available on the Internet, some of which may
        not be fitting with the particular values of the families of the students. It is not practically
        possible for the District to monitor and enforce a wide range of social values in student
        use of the Internet. Further, the District recognizes that parents bear primary
        responsibility for transmitting their particular set of family values to their children. The
        District will encourage parents to specify to their child(ren) what material is and is not
        acceptable for their child(ren) to access through the ACSNet system, in accordance with
        existing District standards.
     4. The District will provide students and parents with guidelines for student safety while
        using the Internet.</p>
<p>F.    District Limitation of Liability
The District makes no warranties of any kind, either express or implied, that the functions or the</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3225/7320                                               Page 3 of 17
services provided by or through the ACSNet system will be error-free or without defect. The
District will not be responsible for any damage users may suffer, including but not limited to,
loss of data or interruptions of service. The District is not responsible for the accuracy or quality
of the information obtained through or stored on the system. The District will not be responsible
for financial obligations arising through the unauthorized use of the system.</p>
<p>G.      Due Process
     1. The District will cooperate fully with local, state, or federal officials in any investigation
        concerning to or relating to any illegal activities conducted through the ACSNet system.
     2. In the event there is an allegation that a student has violated the ACSNet Acceptable Use
        policy, the student will be provided with notice and opportunity to be heard in the manner
        set forth in the policies of the Avery County Board of Education. The student's access to
        the ACSNet system may be suspended pending the result of an investigation into
        allegations of unacceptable use.
     3. Disciplinary actions will be tailored to meet specific concerns related to the violation and
        to assist the student in gaining the self-discipline necessary to behave appropriately on an
        electronic network. If the alleged violation also involves a violation of other provisions of
        the policies of the Avery County Board of Education, the violation will be handled in
        accord with the applicable provision of the Avery County Board of Education Policy
        Manual.
     4. Employee violations of the District Acceptable Use Policy will be handled in accord with
        NCGS 115C-325(e)(1). The employee's access to the ACSNet system may be suspended
        pending the result of an investigation into allegations of unacceptable use.
     5. Any District administrator may terminate the account privileges of a guest user by
        providing notice to the user. Guest accounts not active for more than 30 days may be
        removed, along with the user's files without notice to the user.
     6. All student accounts, including all files stored either locally on desktop computers or on
        ACSNet storage devices, may be removed at the end of each school year in preparation
        for the coming school year. The deletion will occur following seven calendar days from
        the last day students attend school.</p>
<p>H.      Search and Seizure
     1. ACSNet system users have no expectation of privacy in the contents of their personal
        files on the ACSNet system. Personal files include, but are not limited to, stored data and
        email data.
     2. Routine maintenance and monitoring of the system may lead to discovery that the user
        has or is violating the District ACSNet Acceptable Use Policy, the policies of the Avery
        County Board of Education or the law.
     3. An individual search will be conducted if there is reasonable suspicion on the part of
        district or building administrative personnel that a user has violated the District ACSNet
        Acceptable Use Policy, the policies of the Avery County Board of Education or the law.
        The nature of the investigation will be reasonable and in the context of the nature of the
        alleged violation.
     4. District employees should be aware that their personal files may be discoverable under</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3225/7320                                             Page 4 of 17
        North Carolina State Law.</p>
<p>I.      Copyright and Plagiarism
     1. District policies on copyright will govern the use of material accessed through the
        ACSNet system. Because the extent of copyright protection of certain works found on the
        Internet is unclear, system users will make a standard practice of requesting permission
        from the holder of the work if their use of the material has the potential of being
        considered an infringement. Teachers will instruct students to respect copyright and to
        request permission when appropriate.
     2. The policies of the Avery County Board of Education on plagiarism will govern use of
        material accessed through the ACSNet system. Teachers will instruct students in
        appropriate research and citation practices.</p>
<p>J.      Academic Freedom, Selection of Material, Student Rights to Free Speech
     1. Board policies on Academic Freedom and Free Speech will govern the use of the
        Internet.
     2. When using the Internet for class activities, teachers will select material that is
        appropriate in light of the age of the students and that is the relevant to the course
        objectives. Teachers will preview the materials and sites they require or recommend
        students access to determine the appropriateness of the material contained on or accessed
        through the site. Teachers will provide guidelines and lists of resources to assist their
        students in channeling their research activities effectively and properly. Teachers will
        assist their students in developing the skills to ascertain the truthfulness of information,
        distinguish fact from opinion, and engage in discussions about controversial issues while
        demonstrating tolerance and respect for those who hold divergent views.</p>
<p>K.      District Web Site
        District Web Site. The District will establish a Web site and will develop Web pages that
        will present information about the District. The Director of Information Technology
        Services, or his/her appointee will be designated the Webmaster, responsible for
        maintaining the District Web site. Avery County School Board of Education Policy
        3227/7322 governs the creation and management of the district website and all websites
        contained therein.</p>
<p>L.     District Acceptable Use Policy
The following uses of the ACSNet system are considered unacceptable:
        1. Personal Safety
            a. Students will not post personal contact information about themselves or other
               people. Personal contact information includes name, address, telephone, school
               address, work address, etc.
            b. Students will not agree to meet with someone they have met online without their
               parent's approval and participation.
            c. Students will promptly disclose to their teacher or to another school employee any</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3225/7320                                           Page 5 of 17
              message they receive that is inappropriate or makes them feel uncomfortable.
          d. Employees will promptly disclose to their supervisor any message they receive
             that is inappropriate.
   2. Illegal Activities
          a. Users will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the ACSNet system or to
             any other computer system through the ACSNet system, or go beyond their
             authorized access. This includes attempting to log in through another person's
             account or access another person's files. These actions are illegal, even if only for
             the purposes of "browsing".
          b. Users will not make deliberate attempts to disrupt the computer system
             performance or destroy data by spreading computer viruses or by any other
             means. These actions are illegal.
          c. Users will not use the ACSNet system to engage in any other illegal act, such as
             arranging for a drug sale or the purchase of alcohol, engaging in criminal gang
             activity, threatening the safety of persons, etc.
   3. System                                                                      Security
      The ACSNet Technology Resources Security Policy 6526 governs all aspects of ACSNet
      system security.
   4. Inappropriate Language
          a. Restrictions against inappropriate language apply to public messages, private
             messages, text messages and material posted on Web pages.
          b. Users will not use obscene, profane, lewd, vulgar, rude, inflammatory,
             threatening, or disrespectful language.
          c. Users will not post information that, if acted upon, could cause damage or a
             danger of disruption.
          d. Users will not engage in personal attacks, including prejudicial or discriminatory
             attacks.
          e. Users will not harass another person. Harassment is persistently acting in a
             manner that distresses or annoys another person. If a user is told by a person to
             stop sending them messages, they must stop.
          f. Users will not knowingly or recklessly post false or defamatory information about
             a person or organization.
   5. Respect for Privacy
          a. Users will not repost a message that was sent to them privately without
             permission of the person who sent them the message.
          b. Users will not post private information about another person.
   6. Respecting Resource Limits.
          a. Users will use the system only for educational and professional or career
             development activities, and limited, high-quality, self-discovery activities that are
             directly related to the educational objectives of the District.
          b. The District maintains an “everyone” email group to facilitate broadcast delivery</p>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3225/7320                                         Page 6 of 17
             of messages to all users. Users will restrict the use of the “everyone” account to
             business-related messages of general interest to all District employees.
          c. Users will not download large files unless absolutely necessary. If necessary,
             users will download the file at a time when the system is not being heavily used
             and immediately remove the file from the system computer to their personal
             computer.
          d. Users will not download and/or install any program files either from the Internet
             or from diskette, CDROM or other media without the permission of building or
             district technology support staff.
          e. Users will not post chain letters or engage in "spamming". Spamming is sending
             an annoying or unnecessary message to a large number of people.
          f. Users will check their e-mail frequently, delete unwanted messages promptly, and
             stay within their e-mail quota. The District reserves the right to enforce storage
             limits on email/data storage without the permission of the user.
          g. Users will be subscribed only to high quality discussion group mail lists that are
             relevant to their education or professional/career development.
   7. Plagiarism and Copyright Infringement
          a. Users will not plagiarize works that they find on the Internet. Plagiarism is taking
             the ideas or writings of others and presenting them as if they were original to the
             user.
          b. Users will respect the rights of copyright owners. Copyright infringement occurs
             when an individual inappropriately reproduces a work that is protected by a
             copyright. If a work contains language that specifies acceptable use of that work,
             the user should follow the expressed requirements. If the user is unsure whether or
             not they can use a work, they should request permission from the copyright
             owner.
   8. Inappropriate Access to Material
          a. Users will not use the ACSNet system to access material that is profane or
             obscene (pornography), that advocates illegal acts, or that advocates violence or
             discrimination towards other people (hate literature). For students, a special
             exception may be made for violence/hate literature if both the teacher and the
             parent approve the purpose of such access to conduct research. District employees
             may access the above material only in the context of legitimate research.
          b. If a user inadvertently accesses such information, they should immediately
             disclose the inadvertent access in a manner specified by their school. This will
             protect users against an allegation that they have intentionally violated the
             ACSNet                    Acceptable                Use                  policy.</p>

<p>Employee Acceptable Use Policy</p>
<p>Avery County Schools offers computer network/Internet access for employee use. This
document contains the ACSNet Acceptable Use policy for employee use of the ACSNet system.</p>
<p>A. Educational Purpose
   1. ACSNet has been established for a limited educational purpose. The term "educational
      purpose" includes use of the system for administrative support activities, classroom
      activities, career development, and limited high-quality self-discovery activities. The
      limited, high-quality self-discovery activities should be directly related to the educational
      objectives of the District. Any self-discovery activities not directly related to the
      educational objectives of the District must be limited to times outside of normal work
      hours.
   2. ACSNet has not been established as a public access service or a public forum. Avery
      County Schools has the right to place reasonable restrictions on the material employees
      access or post through the system. The employee is also expected to follow the rules set
      forth in the District Acceptable Use Policy and the law in employee use of ACSNet.
   3. The employee may not use ACSNet for commercial purposes. This means the employee
      may not offer or provide products or services through ACSNet.
   4. The employee may not use the system for political activities during school hours, or for
      political activities that involve school monies or that make use of an official school
      position to encourage or coerce students or other employees to support in any way a
      political party, candidate, or issue. Employees may use the system to communicate with
      their elected representatives and to express their opinion on political issues.
   5. District employees and guests must sign an agreement annually that they understand and
      will adhere to this policy (See Procedure – ACSNet Acceptable Use Policy Agreement
      Form)</p>
<p>B. Access to Networked Services
   1. World Wide Web: District employees may have access to the Web through the District's
      networked computers.
   2. Individual E-mail Accounts for District Employees: District employees may be provided
      with an individual email account.
   3. Other Services: Other networked services will be provided to District employees based
      on      the      requirements     of      the       employee's       job     function.</p>
<p>C. Private Employee Websites
All employees are required to use the Avery County Schools' district network when creating
websites, networking sites, blogs, e-mail or other web-based instructional tools for any and all</p>

<p>educational and work related postings or communications with students.</p>
<p>Employees are to maintain an appropriate relationship with students at all times. Having a pubic
personal website or online networking profile or allowing access to a private website or private
online networking profile is considered a form of direct communications with students.
Employees are encouraged to block students from viewing any material or profiles that are not
age appropriate. Any employee found to have created and/or posted inappropriate content on a
website or profile that has a negative impact on the employee's ability to perform their job as it
relates to working with students will be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal.</p>
<p>This section applies to all employees, volunteers and student teachers working for or in the
Avery County School System.</p>
<p>D. Unacceptable Uses
The following uses of ACSNet are considered unacceptable:
   1. Personal Safety. The employee will promptly disclose to his or her supervisor, building
      technical support staff, or District technical support staff any message received that is
      inappropriate or that makes them feel uncomfortable.
   2. Illegal Activities
           a. The employee will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to ACSNet or to any
              other computer system through ACSNet or go beyond his/her authorized access.
              This includes attempting to log in through another person's account or access
              another person's files. These actions are illegal, even if only for the purposes of
              "browsing".
           b. The employee will not make deliberate attempts to disrupt the computer system or
              destroy data by spreading computer viruses or by any other means. These actions
              are illegal.
           c. The employee will not use the ACSNet system to engage in any other illegal act,
              such as arranging for a drug sale or the purchase of alcohol, engaging in criminal
              activity, threatening the safety of persons, or other illegal activities not expressed
              here.
   3.                                                    System                Security
   The ACSNet Technology Resources Security Policy 6526 governs all aspects of ACSNet
   system security.
   4.   Inappropriate Language
                  a. Restrictions against inappropriate language apply to public messages,
                     private messages, text messages and material posted on Web pages.
                  b. The employee will not use obscene, profane, lewd, vulgar, rude,

                discriminatory attacks.
             e. The employee will not harass another person. Harassment is persistently
                acting in a manner that distresses or annoys another person. If the
                employee is told by a person to stop sending them messages, they must
                stop.
             f. The employee will not knowingly or recklessly post false or defamatory
                information about a person or organization.

<li>Respect for Privacy
          a. The employee will not repost a message that was sent to them privately without
             permission of the person who sent the message.
          b. The employee will not post private information about another person.</li>
<li>Respecting Resource Limits.
                 a. The employee should use the system only for educational and career
                    development activities and limited, high-quality, self-discovery activities
                    that are directly related to the District’s educational objectives. Any self-
                    discovery activities not directly related to the educational objectives of the
                    District must be limited to times outside of normal work hours and should
                    not interfere with the overall operation of the ACSNet system.
                 b. The District maintains an “everyone” email group to facilitate broadcast
                    delivery of messages to all users. Employees and guests will restrict the
                    use of the “everyone” account to business-related messages of general
                    interest to all District employees.
                 c. The employee will not download large files unless absolutely necessary. If
                    necessary, files will be downloaded at a time when the system is not being

                 e. The employee will not post chain letters or engage in "spamming".
                    Spamming is sending an annoying or unnecessary message to a large
                    number of people.
                 f. The employee will check their email frequently, delete unwanted
                    messages promptly, and stay within their email quota. The District

<li>Plagiarism and Copyright Infringement
          a. The employee will not plagiarize works that found on the Internet. Plagiarism is
             taking the ideas or writings of others and presenting them as if they were yours.
          b. The employee will respect the rights of copyright owners. Copyright infringement
             occurs when you inappropriately reproduce a work that is protected by a
             copyright. If a work contains language that specifies appropriate use of that work,
             the employee should follow the expressed requirements. If the employee is unsure
             whether or not a work can be used, permission should be requested from the
             copyright owner.</li>
<li>Inappropriate Access to Material
                 a. The employee will not use ACSNet to access material that is profane or
                    obscene (pornography), that advocates illegal acts, or that advocates
                    violence or discrimination towards other people (hate literature). A special
                    exception may be made for violence/hate literature if the purpose of the
                    access is to conduct research.
                 b. If the employee mistakenly accesses inappropriate information, the
                    employee should immediately tell their supervisor or District technical
                    support staff. This will protect the employee against a claim that they have
                    intentionally violated this Policy.</li>

<p>D. Your Rights
   1. Free                                                                               Speech
      The employee's right to free speech applies to their communication on the Internet.
      ACSNet is considered a limited forum and therefore the District may restrict the

      the basis of a disagreement with the opinions being expressed.
   2. Search and Seizure.
          a. The employee has no expectation of privacy in the contents of their personal files
             on the ACSNet system. Personal files include, but are not limited to, stored data
             and email data.
          b. Routine maintenance and monitoring of ACSNet may lead to discovery that the
             employee has violated this Policy or the law.
          c. An individual search will be conducted if there is reasonable suspicion that the
             employee has violated this Policy or the law. The investigation will be reasonable</p>

          the District may be discontinued, pending the outcome of the investigation.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Due Process

              investigation related to any illegal activities conducted through ACSNet.
           b. In the event there is a claim that employee has violated this Policy or the law in
              their use of the ACSNet, the employee will be provided with notice and
              opportunity to be heard in the manner set forth by the laws of the State of North
              Carolina and the rules and regulations of the Avery County Board of Education.</li>
</ol>
<p>E. Limitation of Liability

ACSNet system will be error-free or without defect. The District will not be responsible for any
damage the employee may suffer, including but not limited to, loss of data or interruptions of

<p>Student Acceptable Use Policy</p>
<p>Avery County Schools offers computer network/Internet access for student use. This document

   3. You may not use ACSNet for commercial purposes. This means you may not offer,
      provide, or purchase products or services through ACSNet.
   4. You may not use the system for political activities during school hours, or for political

                                                                      Policy Code:   3225 / 7320</p>
<pre><code>   communicate with your elected representatives and to express your opinion on political

      their classroom, library, or school computer lab.
   2. Elementary and Middle School students will have email access only under their teacher's
      direct supervision using a shared classroom account. Elementary and Middle School
      students may be provided with individual email accounts under special circumstances, at
      the request of their teacher and with the approval of their parent. You and your parent
      must sign an Account Agreement to be granted an individual email account on ACSNet.
      This Agreement must be renewed on an annual basis. Your parent can withdraw their
      approval at any time.
   3. Secondary students may obtain an individual email account with the written approval of
      their parent. You and your parent must sign an Account Agreement to be granted an
      individual email account on ACSNet. This Agreement must be renewed on an annual
      basis. Your parent can withdraw their approval at any time.</p>
<p>C. Unacceptable Uses
The following uses of ACSNet are considered unacceptable:
   1. Personal Safety
          a. You will not post personal contact information about yourself or other people.
             Personal contact information includes your name, address, telephone, school
             address, work address, etc.
          b. You will not agree to meet with someone you have met online without your
             parent's approval. Your parent should accompany you to this meeting.
          c. You will promptly disclose to your teacher or other school employee any message
             you receive that is inappropriate or makes you feel uncomfortable.
   2. Illegal Activities
          a. You will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to ACSNet or to any other
             computer system through ACSNet or go beyond your authorized access. This
             includes attempting to log in through another person's account or access another
             person's files. These actions are illegal, even if only for the purposes of
             "browsing".
          b. You will not make deliberate attempts to disrupt the computer system or destroy
             data by spreading computer viruses or by any other means. These actions are
             illegal.
          c. You will not use the ACSNet system to engage in any other illegal act, such as</p>

<pre><code>         arranging for a drug sale or the purchase of alcohol, engaging in criminal gang
         activity, threatening the safety of persons, or other illegal activities not expressed
         here.

<li>System                                                                      Security
      The ACSNet Technology Resources Security Policy 6526 governs all aspects of ACSNet
      system security.</li>
<li>Inappropriate Language
          a. Restrictions against Inappropriate Language apply to public messages, private
             messages, and material posted on Web pages.
          a. You will not use obscene, profane, lewd, vulgar, rude, inflammatory, threatening,
             or disrespectful language.
          b. You will not post information that could cause damage or a danger of disruption.
          c. You will not engage in personal attacks, including prejudicial or discriminatory
             attacks.
          d. You will not harass another person. Harassment is persistently acting in a manner
             that distresses or annoys another person. If you are told by a person to stop
             sending them messages, you must stop.
          e. You will not knowingly or recklessly post false or defamatory information about a
             person or organization.</li>
<li>Respect for Privacy
          a. You will not repost a message that was sent to you privately without permission
             of the person who sent you the message.
          b. You will not post private information about another person.</li>
<li>Respecting Resource Limits.
          a. You will use the system only for educational and career development activities
             and limited, high-quality, self-discovery activities that are directly related to the
             District’s educational objectives.
          b. Students are not permitted to use the “everyone” email group.
          c. You will not download large files unless absolutely necessary.
          d. You will not download and/or install any program files either from the Internet or
             from diskette, CDROM or other media without the permission of building or
             district technology support staff.
          e. You will not post chain letters or engage in "spamming". Spamming is sending an
             annoying or unnecessary message to a large number of people.
          f. You will check your email frequently, delete unwanted messages promptly, and
             stay within your email quota. The district reserves the right to enforce storage</li>

<pre><code>          limits on email/data storage without your permission.
      g. You will subscribe only to high quality discussion group mail lists and other list
         server services that are relevant to your education or career development.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Plagiarism and Copyright Infringement
          a. You will not plagiarize works that you find on the Internet. Plagiarism is taking
             the ideas or writings of others and presenting them as if they were yours.
          b. You will respect the rights of copyright owners. Copyright infringement occurs
             when you inappropriately reproduce a work that is protected by a copyright. If a
             work contains language that specifies appropriate use of that work, you should
             follow the expressed requirements. If you are unsure whether or not you can use a
             work, you should request permission from the copyright owner. If you have
             questions, ask a teacher or your school’s media specialist.</li>
<li>Inappropriate Access to Material
          a. You will not use ACSNet to access material that is profane or obscene
             (pornography), that advocates illegal acts, or that advocates violence or
             discrimination towards other people (hate literature). A special exception may be
             made for violence/hate literature if the purpose of your access is to conduct
             research and both your teacher and parent have approved.
          b. If you mistakenly access inappropriate information, you should immediately tell
             your teacher or another District employee. This will protect you against a claim
             that you have intentionally violated this Policy.
          c. Your parents should instruct you if there is additional material that they think it
             would be inappropriate for you to access. The district fully expects that you will
             follow your parent's instructions in this matter.
D. Your Rights</li>
<li>Free                                                                             Speech
      Your right to free speech applies to your communication on the Internet. ACSNet is
      considered a limited forum, and therefore the District may restrict your speech for valid
      educational reasons. The District will not restrict your speech on the basis of a

           pending the outcome of the investigation.
       c. Your parents have the right at any time to request to see the contents of your data
          file storage and email files.

              investigation related to any illegal activities conducted through ACSNet.
           b. In the event there is a claim that you have violated this Policy, the policies of the
              Avery County Board of Education, or the law in your use of the ACSNet, you will
              be provided with notice and opportunity to be heard in the manner set forth in the
              Avery County Board of Education Policy Manual.
           c. If the violation also involves a violation of other provisions of the policies of the
              Avery County Board of Education, it will be handled in a manner described in
              Avery County Board of Education Policy Manual. Additional restrictions may be
              placed on your use of your Internet account.</li>
