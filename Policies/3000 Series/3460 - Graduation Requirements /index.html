<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 3460</p>
<p>GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Avery County Board of Education recognizes the importance of setting rigorous
graduation requirements in order to help ensure that students are receiving an education
that will prepare them to be college and career ready and productive members of society.</p>
<p>In order to graduate from high school, students will be required to meet the minimum
requirements:</p>
<pre><code>1. successful completion of all course unit requirements mandated by the State
   Board of Education (see Section A);
2. beginning in the 2014-2015 school year, successful completion of
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation instruction; and
3. successful completion of all other requirements mandated by the board, as
   provided in this policy.
</code></pre>
<p>The principal shall ensure that parents and students are aware of all graduation
requirements. Guidance program staff shall assist students in selecting their high school
courses to ensure that students are taking all of the required units and selecting electives
consistent with their post-graduation plans. For students who have transferred to the
school district during high school, or who for other reasons have completed course work
outside of the school district, the principal will determine what course work will be
applied as credit for graduation. The principal shall consider the requirements of the
Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunities for Military Children (G.S. 115C-407.5)
and the requirements of subsection C.3 of this policy in determining the graduation
requirements for children of military families.</p>
<p>A. COURSE UNITS REQUIRED</p>
<p>Each student must meet the course unit requirements for one of the following courses of
study. Students entering the ninth grade for the first time in the 2009-2010 school year
must fulfill the requirements of the Future-Ready Occupational Course of Study. Course
unit requirements for the Future-Ready Core Course of Study differ depending on the
year a student enters ninth grade for the first time, as set out in the table below. In
accordance with policy 3101, Dual Enrollment, and State Board of Education
requirements, students may earn high school credit for college courses completed. In
addition, students may earn credit for certain high school courses in the Future-Ready
Core Course of Study completed while in middle school, as authorized by the State Board
of Education. Students also have the opportunity to meet course unit requirements
without completing the regular period of classroom instruction by demonstrating mastery
of the course material in accordance with policy 3420, Student Promotion and
Accountability, and State Board of Education requirements.</p>
<p>All awards of high school course credit must be consistent with State Board of Education
requirements. Any inconsistency between board policy and State Board graduation
requirements will be resolved by following the State Board requirements.</p>

<li>
<p>Students with Disabilities
   Graduation requirements must be applied to students with disabilities to the extent
   required by state and federal law and State Board policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children of Military Families
      In order to facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, the
      board adopts the following policy provisions for students covered by the Interstate
      Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children.</p>
<pre><code>a. Waiver Requirements
        Specific course work required for graduation will be waived if similar
        course work has been satisfactorily completed in another school system.
        If a waiver is not granted, school administrators shall provide the student
        with reasonable justification for the denial. If a waiver is not granted to a
        student who would qualify to graduate from the sending school, the
        superintendent or designee shall provide the student with an alternative
        means of acquiring the required coursework so that graduation may occur
        on time.
b. Testing Requirements for Graduation
       The superintendent shall accept the following in lieu of any local testing
       requirements for graduation: (1) end-of-course exams required for
       graduation from the sending state; (2) national norm-referenced
       achievement tests; or (3) alternative testing. If these alternatives are not
       feasible for a student who has transferred in his or her senior year,
       subsection c below will apply.
c. Transfers During Senior Year
       If a child of a military family who has transferred at the beginning of or
       during his or her senior year is ineligible to graduate from the school
       system after all of the alternatives listed above have been considered and
       the student meets the graduation requirements at his or her sending school,
       then school officials from the school system shall collaborate with the
       sending school system to ensure that the student will receive a diploma
       from the sending board of education.

       standards set forth in State Board policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Diploma Endorsements</li>
</ol>
<p>Beginning with the graduating class of 2014-2015, students will have the opportunity to
      earn an endorsement to their diploma identifying a particular area of focused
      study including: (1) Career Endorsement, (2) College Endorsement (two options),
      (3) North Carolina Academic Scholars Endorsement, and/or (4) a Global
      Languages Endorsement. No endorsement is required to receive a diploma.</p>
