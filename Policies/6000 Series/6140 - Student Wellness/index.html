<p>Avery County Schools Policy
Policy Code: 6140</p>
<pre><code>  STUDENT WELLNESS
</code></pre>
<p>The Avery County Board of Education recognizes the importance of students maintaining
physical health and proper nutrition in order to take advantage of educational
opportunities. The board further recognizes that student wellness and proper nutrition are
related to a student’s physical well being, growth, development and readiness to learn.
The board is committed to providing a school environment that promotes student
wellness, proper nutrition, nutrition education and regular physical activity as part of the
total learning experience. As part of that commitment, the board directs the
superintendent to oversee the development, implementation, and ongoing evaluation of
this policy and other school system efforts to encourage students to be healthy and active,
including compliance with the State Board of Education’s Healthy Active Children
Policy, SHLT-000, as further described in Section F, below. The superintendent may
designate a school system official to carry out this responsibility (“lead wellness
official”).</p>
<p>The superintendent or designee shall make the most current version of this policy
available to members of the school community and the public by posting it on the school
system website and/or by distributing it annually through other means reasonably
intended to reach the school community and public. In addition, the superintendent or
designee shall provide a copy of this policy to the North Carolina Department of Public
Instruction (NCDPI) when requested to do so.</p>
<p>A.      SCHOOL HEALTH ADVISORY COUNCIL</p>
<pre><code>    The School Health Advisory Council will help plan, update, implement, promote,
    and monitor this policy as well as to address other health and nutrition issues
    within the school system. The council serves as an advisory committee regarding
    student health issues and works in conjunction with the lead wellness official
    charged with oversight of this policy and the school system’s efforts to promote
    student and employee health and wellness in compliance with the state and federal
    requirements. The council is authorized to examine related research and laws,
    assess student needs and the current school environment, review existing board
    policies and administrative regulations, collaborate with appropriate community
    agencies and organizations, and help raise awareness about student health issues.
    The council also may make policy recommendations to the board related to this
    policy and other policies concerning student wellness and, in conjunction with the
    lead wellness official, shall periodically review and suggest revisions to this
    policy. In addition, the council may assist in the development of a plan for
    measuring and assessing implementation of this policy and in developing methods
    to inform and update the public about the content and implementation of this
    policy as described in Sections F and G, below.

    The council will be composed of representatives from the school system, the local
    health department, and the community. The council must include members of
    each of the following groups: the school board, school system administrators,
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140                                           Page 1 of 10
        school system food service representatives, physical education teachers, school
        health professionals, students, parents or guardians, and the public. The council
        will provide information in the following areas or concerns: (1) physical activity,
        (2) health education, (3) employee wellness, (4) health services, (5) social and
        emotional climate, (6) nutrition environment and services, (7) counseling,
        psychological, and social services, (8) physical environment, (9) family
        engagement, and (10) community involvement.</p>
<pre><code>    The council will provide periodic reports to the board and public regarding the
    status of its work. In addition, the council will assist the lead wellness official in
    creating an annual report which includes the minutes of physical activity and the
    minutes of physical education and/or healthful living education received by
    students in the district each school year, and any other information required by the
    State Board of Education or NCDPI.
</code></pre>
<p>B.      NUTRITION PROMOTION AND NUTRITION EDUCATION</p>
<pre><code>    The board believes that promoting student health and nutrition enhances readiness
    for learning and increases student achievement. The general goals of nutrition
    promotion and nutrition education are (1) to provide appropriate instruction for
    the acquisition of behaviors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle for students and
    (2) to teach, encourage and support healthy eating by students. The ACS Annual
    Report shall show measureable goals for nutrition promotion and nutrition
    education.

    The board will provide nutrition education within the Healthful Living Standard
    Course of Study and the grade level expectations outlined in the Healthful Living
    Essential Standards adopted by the State Board of Education. Nutrition education
    should be designed to provide all students with the knowledge and skills needed
    to lead healthy lives. Students should learn to address nutrition-related health
    concerns through age-appropriate nutrition education lessons and activities.

    Nutrition education should extend beyond the school environment by engaging
    and involving families and communities. School district personnel may coordinate
    with agencies and community organizations to provide opportunities for
    appropriate student projects related to nutrition. School district personnel will
    work to disseminate consistent nutrition messages throughout the school district,
    schools, classrooms, school dining areas, homes, community and media.

    In conjunction with the school health advisory council, the board establishes the
    following additional specific evidence-based goals and strategies for nutrition
    promotion and education. The board will periodically measure and report progress
    toward meeting these goals.

        •   Nutrition education that aligns with national dietary guidelines and
            adheres to state academic standards will be incorporated into health
            education classes and/or stand-alone courses for all grade levels. The
            nutrition curriculum will encompass:
                o promotion of adequate nutrient intake and healthy eating practices;
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140                                            Page 2 of 10
                    o skill development, such as meal planning, recognizing food groups
                        within a meal, and understanding health information and food
                        labels to evaluate the nutrient content and contribution of foods;
                    o study of the problems associated with food marketing to children;
                        and
                    o food safety.
            •   Employees will use only approved nutrition curriculum in the classroom.
                Curriculum developed by corporate interests will not be used unless it
                meets curricular standards.
            •   Teachers will integrate nutrition education into core curriculum areas such
                as math, science, social studies, and language arts, as well as in non-core
                and elective subjects.
            •   Nutrition promotion will include participatory activities such as contests,
                surveys, promotions, voting for school meal recipe names, cafeteria design
                or décor challenges, farm visits, and experience working in school
                gardens.
            •   The nutrition education program will be linked to school meal programs,
                school gardens, cafeteria nutrition promotions, and farm-to-school
                programs.
            •   Nutrition education will be provided to families via handouts, newsletters,
                website posts, presentations, and workshops. The school menu will be
                posted online.
            •   Nutrition education will be offered in the cafeteria as well as the
                classroom, with coordination between the foodservice staff and teachers.
            •   Nutrition education will promote fruits, vegetables, whole-grain products,
                healthy food preparation methods, and accurate portion sizes.
            •   School nutrition program staff at each school will employ at least three
                tools or strategies suggested in the USDA “Smarter Lunchrooms”
                publication (available at http://healthymeals.nal.usda.gov/healthierus-
                school-challenge-resources/smarter-lunchrooms) to increase student
                participation in the federal school lunch and breakfast programs and to
                encourage students to make healthy food choices.
            •   Nutrition and health posters, signage, and/or displays will be exhibited in
                the cafeteria food service and dining areas, classrooms, hallways,
                gymnasium, and/or bulletin boards and will be frequently rotated, updated,
                or changed.
            •   Students will have opportunities to taste foods that are low in saturated
                and trans fats, sodium, and added sugar.
            •   Families will be requested to pack lunches and snacks that meet school
                system nutrition standards and will be provided with written guidance on
                how to accomplish this.
            •   School personnel will strive to provide a pleasant eating experience for
                students and adults by adopting the following practices:
                    o Student input is solicited for meal choices.
                    o Nutrient analysis is available to teachers, parents, students, and
                        health professionals when possible.
                    o Adequate time to eat is provided. The recommended eating time

                         minutes lunch. School personnel will schedule enough time, lunch
                         periods, and serving lines so students do not have to spend
                         excessive time waiting in line.
                     o Adult supervision and role modeling are available during the meal
                         service times to encourage students to eat meals.
                     o Drinking fountains will be available for students to get water at
                         meals and throughout the day.
               •    As marketing/advertising tools (kiosks, vending machines, signage,
                    etc.) are replaced within the LEA, new tools will promote foods and/or
                    beverages that are consistent with the Smart Snacks nutrition standards
                    and the school nutrition meal pattern requirements.
               •    In negotiating vendor contracts, preference will be given to vendors
                    whose marketing and advertising tools reflect the Smart Snacks
                    nutrition standards and the school nutrition meal pattern requirements.
               •    The LEA will collaborate with vendors to gradually replace or modify
                    vending machines to ensure all signage for the machine promotes
                    products that are consistent with the Smart Snacks nutrition standards
                    and the school nutrition meal pattern.</p>
<p>C.      PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</p>
<pre><code>    1. Goals of the Physical Education Program
    The goal of the physical education program is to promote lifelong physical
    activity and provide instruction in the skills and knowledge necessary for lifelong
    participation in physical activity.         To address issues such as obesity,
    cardiovascular disease, and Type II diabetes, students enrolled in kindergarten
    through eighth grades must have the opportunity to participate in physical activity
    as part of the district’s physical education curriculum.

    2. The Physical Education Course
    The physical education course should be designed to foster support and guidance
    for being physically active, help students know and understand the value of being
    physically fit, and teach students the types of activities that contribute to total
    fitness. The course is to be taught in an environment where students can learn,
    practice and receive assessment on developmentally appropriate skills and
    knowledge as defined in the North Carolina Healthful Living Standard Course of
    Study. Students should be engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity for
    fifty percent or more of class time. The goal is for physical education classes to be
    equivalent in size to those of other academic classes.

    3. Physical Activity Requirements and Goals
    School personnel should strive to provide opportunities for age- and
    developmentally-appropriate physical activity during the day for all students so
    that students can learn to exhibit a physically active lifestyle. A minimum of 30
    minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity will be provided daily by
    schools for kindergarten through eighth-grade students. Such activity may be
    achieved through a regular daily physical education class, recess, dance,
    classroom energizers and/or other curriculum-based physical activity programs of
    at least 10 minutes duration, that, when combined, total 30 minutes of daily

        physical activity. Principals shall work with teachers to ensure that students meet
        the minimum physical activity requirement. The board will periodically measure
        and report progress toward meeting these goals.</p>
<pre><code>    To ensure that students have ongoing opportunities for physical activity and
    maintain a positive attitude towards physical activity, structured/unstructured
    recess and other physical activity shall not be taken away from students as a form
    of punishment. In addition, severe and inappropriate exercise may not be used as
    a form of punishment for students.

    In conjunction with the school health advisory council, the board establishes the
    following additional specific evidence-based goals and strategies for physical
    activity:

        •   Middle and high schools will provide extra-curricular activities that enable
            students to select from a variety of sports and other active endeavors.
        •   Elementary students will be provided the opportunity to participate in
            daily recess.
        •   Classroom health education will reinforce the knowledge and skills
            needed to maintain a physically active lifestyle.
        •   Students will be encouraged to reduce sedentary time and will not be
            required to engage in sedentary activities for more than two hours without
            an opportunity to stretch and move around.
        •   Short (3-5 minute) physical activity breaks will be provided between
            classes in elementary schools.
        •   Teachers will incorporate opportunities for physical activity in the
            classroom whenever possible.
        •   Schools will provide annual fitness testing for all students and provide
            confidential reports directly to parents.

<p>D.    NUTRITION STANDARDS            AND   GUIDELINES   FOR   ALL FOOD     AND   BEVERAGES
AVAILABLE AT SCHOOL</p>
<pre><code>    Consistent with policy 6200, Goals of School Nutrition Services, all foods
    available in the district’s schools during the school day that are offered to students
    should help promote student health, reduce childhood obesity, provide a variety of
    nutritional meals, and promote lifelong healthy eating habits. All foods and
    beverages sold at school must meet the nutrition standards established in policy
    6230, School Meal and Competitive Foods Standards, including the following:

    1. School Lunch, Breakfast, and Snack Programs

    Foods provided through the National School Lunch, School Breakfast, or After
    School Snack Programs must comply with federal and state nutrition standards.
    The director of child nutrition shall ensure that school system guidelines issued
    for reimbursable meals are not less restrictive than regulations and guidelines
    issued for schools in accordance with federal law.
</code></pre>
<p>Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140                                            Page 5 of 10
        2. Competitive Foods</p>
<pre><code>    All foods sold on school campuses in areas that are accessible to students during
    the school day (defined as the period from midnight through 30 minutes after the
    dismissal bell rings) in competition with the National School Lunch or School
    Breakfast Programs (“competitive foods”) must comply with the federal Smart
    Snacks in Schools standards. Vending machine sales also must comply with the
    requirements of G.S. 115C-264.2 and Eat Smart: North Carolina’s Recommended
    Standards for All Foods in Schools. Competitive foods include food, snacks and
    beverages from a la carte menus, vending machines and outside suppliers, as well
    as foods or beverages sold in school stores and at fund-raisers.

    3. Other Foods Available on the School Campus During the School Day and After
    the School Day

    School principals shall establish rules for foods and beverages brought from home
    for classroom events or parties during the school day or for extracurricular
    activities after the school day. The board encourages principals to establish rules
    that are consistent with the Smart Snacks in Schools standards.

    Fundraising activities that involve the sale of foods and/or beverages to students
    during the school day (from midnight until 30 minutes after the dismissal bell
    rings) must comply with the Smart Snack Rules and may not be conducted until
    after the end of the last lunch period. (See policy 6230, School Meal and
    Competitive Foods Standards.)

    School principals may establish standards for fundraising activities conducted
    after the school day (beginning 31 minutes after the dismissal bell rings) that
    involve the sale of food and/or beverages. The board encourages alternative
    fundraising activities such as non-food items or physical activity.

    4. Food and Beverage Marketing

    Food and beverage marketing on school campuses during the school day must
    meet federal and state standards. In accordance with these standards, only foods
    and beverages that meet the Smart Snack standards (as described in subsection
    C.2. above) may be marketed or advertised on school campuses during the school
    day. To comply with this requirement, existing supplies, materials, or equipment
    that depict noncompliant products or logos will be replaced or removed in
    accordance with normal lifecycles or as otherwise would occur in the normal
    course of business.
</code></pre>
<p>E.      OTHER SCHOOL-BASED ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE WELLNESS</p>
<pre><code>    In addition to the standards discussed above, the board adopts the following goals
    for school-based activities designed to promote wellness:

    1. Schools will provide a clean and safe meal environment.

       planning all school-based activities.

    8. Administrators, teachers, school nutrition personnel, students,
       parents/guardians and community members will be encouraged to serve as
       positive role models to promote student wellness.
