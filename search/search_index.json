GOVERNING(PRINCIPLES Policies are the primary means by which the board expresses its vision for the school district. In formulating specific policies, the board is guided by its duty to provide students with the opportunity to receive a sound basic education as defined by the North Carolina Supreme Court in Leandro v. State. It is further guided by governing principles it considers critical to meet that obligation by providing a system of excellent schools where students can succeed. These governing principles are referenced frequently in the board policies and also are set out below. Student success. As its top priority, a system of excellent schools provides opportunities for individual students to succeed and overall student performance to improve. Parental involvement. A system of excellent schools involves parents in decisions regarding their own children, the educational program and the schools. Safe, orderly and inviting environment. A system of excellent schools creates and maintains a safe and orderly environment where staff and students are focused on and excited about learning. School initiatives. In a system of excellent schools, each school initiates improvements to the educational program and services for students and involves staff, parents and students in the school level decision-making processes. Professional development. A system of excellent schools provides continuous professional development and training to help personnel gain the skills and knowledge needed to meet State Board and local board expectations, especially as they relate to improving student performance. Removal of barriers. A system of excellent schools prohibits illegal discrimination and harassment of staff and students, encourages tolerance and respect, and seeks to eliminate or lessen other barriers that may impede a student's ability or opportunity to learn, including economic disadvantages, poor nutrition, ill-health and lack of transportation. Stewardship of resources. A system of excellent schools conserves financial and environmental resources and operates in an efficient manner. Legal References: G.S. 115C-36, -47; Leandro v.

The board directs school administrators to develop programs that will promote and support parental involvement in student learning and achievement at school and at home and encourage successful progress toward graduation. Each parent is encouraged to learn about the educational program, the educational goals and objectives of the school system and his or her own child's progress. The board also encourages parents to participate in activities designed by the schools to involve them, such as parent conferences, in order to encourage effective communication. A. PARENT COMMUNICATION AND CONFERENCES The board encourages regular contact with parents by school personnel for commendation as well as for notification of concerns. Principals or designees shall plan for periodic communication with parents. Teachers are responsible for scheduling conferences with parents. Interim Reports: Notification Concerning Class Grades 1. All middle and high school teachers are required to send interim reports to all students at the mid-point of each grading period. 2. All elementary regular classroom teachers and \u201cteachers of record\u201d for academic classes are required to send interim reports to all students. Special teachers (i.e. art, music, P.E., library, computer, guidance, etc.) are required to send interim reports if a student has had a drop in behavior or performance. 3. If the report indicates a student has had a drop in grade or may not pass the grading period, then Interim Reports must be signed by the parent and returned to the teacher. If the teacher does not receive the signed document from the parent, it is the teacher\u2019s responsibility to call or meet with the parent and document that conversation. 4. Teachers may offer rewards (such as a point added to a final average) for the student returning the interim report. However, punishment may not be used. Notification Concerning Repeating a Grade or a Course If any student is not making satisfactory progress toward promotion or passing the End-of Grade/End-of-Course exam, parents must be notified at the mid-year (elementary and middle school) or mid-semester (high school). This communication must be confirmed by signature of the parent, and/or documented meetings. Notification Concerning High School Graduation If a student may not graduate on time, parents must be notified in person or by certified mail by mid-semester, or as soon as a teacher becomes aware of the problem. The principal or designee shall strive, through oral or written communication or other means, to include the parents of students identified as at- risk in the implementation and review of academic and/or behavioral Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1310/4002 Page 1 of 6 interventions for their children, in accordance with policy 3405, Students at Risk of Academic Failure.The principal or designee shall provide the parent of each student in kindergarten, first, or second grade with written notification of the student\u2019s reading progress. The notice will be provided three times a year, following each benchmark assessment and will include: (1) assessment results, (2) whether the child may not reach reading proficiency by the end of third grade; and (3) instructional support activities for use at home. The board encourages the superintendent to work with local business leaders, including the local chambers of commerce, to encourage employers to adopt as part of their stated personnel policies time for employees who are parents or guardians to attend conferences with their child\u2019s teachers.

The board attaches a high priority to securing the most competent personnel available and, once they are employed, in assisting them in their professional growth and development throughout their careers. The primary purpose of staff development, both for individuals and groups of employees, is to improve the instructional program for all students by assisting teachers and other licensed personnel in improving and gaining even greater competence in their profession. A. STAFF DEVELOPMENT The superintendent will provide ongoing professional staff development opportunities. Input from employees will be sought in developing district-wide programs. Local school staff development programs will be planned jointly by the principal and staff members. Staff development must be provided, at the district or school level, on the effective delivery of the required curriculum, the incorporation of technology in the student learning process, and on subjects clearly matched to the goals and objectives of the local safe school plans. B. SELF-IMPROVEMENT Licensed and professional employees are responsible for self-improvement. These employees are encouraged to seek information and training through staff development programs as well as other opportunities in order to meet this responsibility. C. PLANS FOR GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT Supervisors and principals also may require employees to enter into plans for professional growth and to improve performance. To be most effective, the plan should set clear expectations and facilitate clear communication between the evaluator and the evaluate. A performance improvement plan could involve participation in a staff development program or could encompass a variety of strategies that are related to professional growth or improving performance. Action plans are required for all licensed employees who receive a \u201cbelow standard\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d rating on a performance evaluation. Board policy 7811, Required Action Plans for Certain Licensed Employees, specifically sets forth the requirements for action plans. A plan required by a supervisor/principal may be appealed following the grievance procedure in board policy 1750/7220 if the employee contends that (1) the plan is not likely to improve performance; (2) the supervisor/principal abused his or her discretion in developing the plan; or (3) the plan was not developed in conformance with any mandatory procedures. D. PAYMENT OF COSTS The district will consider paying reasonable costs, within budget limits, for any courses, workshops, seminars, conferences, in-service training sessions or other sessions which an employee is required to attend by the local administration. The employee must seek prior approval for payments. The district will not bear the responsibility of the cost of training taken solely for the purposes of licensure renewal.

OPTIONS FOR RESOLVING COMPLAINTS The board strives to resolve concerns and complaints whenever possible. To this end, the board has provided opportunities for students and parents to express their concerns through processes established in board policies. Board policy 1742/5060, Responding to Complaints, identifies these different processes and provides a mechanism for resolving complaints in an informal manner. While the board encourages informal resolutions, the board recognizes that students and parents may want a more formal process for certain types of complaints or if an informal process was not satisfactory. This policy provides a complaint procedure that can be used as described below. Any parent or student who is unclear of the options for proceeding with a concern may contact the principal\u2019s office or the superintendent\u2019s office for further information and copies of all applicable board policies. B. DEFINITIONS 1. Days means the working days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, vacation days or holidays, as set forth in the school calendar. In counting days, the first day will be the first full working day following the receipt of the grievance. After May 1, time limits will consist of all weekdays (Monday - Friday) so that the matter may be resolved before the close of the school term or as soon thereafter as possible. 2. Final Administrative Decision means a decision of a school employee from which no further appeal to a school administrator is available. 3. Grievance means a formal complaint regarding specific decisions made by school personnel which alleges that such decisions have adversely affected the person making the complaint. A grievance includes, but is not limited to, circumstances such as when a student or parent believes that board policy or law has been misapplied, misinterpreted or violated. Any claims of discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, religion, age or disability also may be submitted as a grievance. The term \u201cgrievance\u201d does not include any matter for which the method of review is prescribed by law, for which there is a more specific board policy providing a process for addressing the concern, or upon which the board is without authority to act. 4. Grievant means the parent or student or group of parents or students submitting the Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1740/4010 Page 1 of 7 grievance. 5. Official means the school district personnel hearing and responding to the grievant. C. TIMELINESS OF PROCESS The number of days indicated at each level should be considered a maximum and every effort should be made to expedite the process. Failure by the official at any step to communicate a decision within the specified time limit will permit the grievant to appeal the grievance to the next step unless the official has notified the grievant of the delay and the reason for the delay, such as the complexity of the investigation or report. The official will make reasonable efforts to keep the grievant apprised of progress being made during any period of delay. Delays are not permitted that interfere with the exercise of any legal rights. Failure by the grievant at any step to appeal a grievance to the next step within the specified time limit will be considered acceptance of the decision at that step, unless the grievant has notified the official of a delay, the reason for the delay and the official has consented in writing to the delay. D. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 1. No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the board or by an employee of the school district against any grievant or other student or employee on account of his or her participation in a grievance filed and decided pursuant to this policy. 2. All meetings and hearings conducted pursuant to this policy will be private. 3. The board and school district will consider requests to hear grievances from a group of grievants, but the board and officials have the discretion to respond to individual grievants. 4. The grievant may have a representative, including an attorney, at any stage of the grievance. However, any grievant intending to be represented by legal counsel must notify the appropriate school official in advance so that school personnel also will have the opportunity to be represented by legal counsel. E. PROCESS FOR GRIEVANCE 1. Reporting Grievance a. Whenever a student or parent/guardian believes that he/she has been adversely affected by a decision of a school employee, the student or parent/guardian may file a grievance as provided in this policy. b. A grievance must be filed as soon as possible but no longer than 30 days after disclosure or discovery of the facts giving rise to the grievance. For a Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1740/4010 Page 2 of 7 grievance submitted after 30 days which claims a violation, misapplication or misinterpretation of state or federal law, including discrimination, the superintendent or designee will determine whether the grievance will be investigated after considering factors such as the reason for the delay; the extent of the delay; the effect of the delay on the ability of the school district to investigate and respond to the complaint; and whether the investigation of the complaint is necessary to meet any legal obligations. However, students and parents should recognize that delays in reporting may significantly impair the ability of the school district to investigate and respond effectively to such complaints. c. A student who has a grievance must provide the following information in writing to the principal: (1) the name of the school district employee or other individual whose decision or action is at issue; (2) the specific decision(s) or actions at issue; (3) any board policy, state or federal law, state or federal regulation, or State Board of Education policy or procedure that the parent or student believes has been misapplied, misinterpreted or violated; (4) and the specific resolution desired. If there is not a specific decision at issue and no concern that state or federal law has been misapplied, misinterpreted or violated, then the procedure established in board policy 1742/5060, Responding to Complaints, is appropriate and the principal will address the concern following that board policy. d. Even if the principal is the employee whose decision or action is at issue, the student will submit the grievance first to the principal in order for the principal to address the issue within the formal process. If, however, the grievance claims that a state or federal law has been misapplied, misinterpreted or violated, the student may submit the grievance directly to the superintendent or the superintendent\u2019s designee. 2. Investigation a. The principal will schedule and hold a meeting with the student and/or parent within five school days of receiving the request. The student may be accompanied by a parent, legal guardian or other person who is in a position of loco parentis to the student. b. The principal will conduct any investigation of the facts necessary before rendering a decision. 3. Response by Principal a. The principal will provide a written response to the written grievance within ten days of the meeting. The response will include the principal\u2019s decision regarding resolution of the grievance and the basis for the decision. In responding, the principal cannot disclose information about other students or employees that by law is considered confidential. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1740/4010 Page 3 of 7 b. A copy of the grievance and the principal\u2019s response will be filed with the superintendent. 4. Response by Superintendent a. If the grievant is dissatisfied with the principal\u2019s decision, the grievant may appeal the decision to the superintendent. The appeal must be made in writing within five days of receiving the principal\u2019s decision. b. The superintendent may review the written documents and respond or the superintendent may schedule and hold a conference with the grievant and principal, and any other individuals the superintendent determines to be appropriate within five school days after receiving the appeal. The student may be accompanied by a parent, legal guardian or other person who is in a position of loco parentis to the student. c. The superintendent will provide a written response within 10 days after receiving the appeal. In responding, the superintendent cannot disclose information about other students or employees that by law is considered confidential. 5. Appeal to the Board If the grievant has alleged a violation of a specified federal or state law, federal or state regulation, State Board of Education policy or procedure, or local board of education policy or procedure, the grievant shall have a right to appeal a final administrative decision to the board of education (see Mandatory Appeals below). If a grievant has not alleged such specific violations, he/she may request a hearing before the board, which the board may grant at its discretion (see Discretionary Appeals below). a. Mandatory Appeals (1) If the grievant is dissatisfied with the superintendent\u2019s response to his/her grievance and has alleged a violation of a specified federal or state law, federal or state regulation, State Board of Education policy or procedure or local board of education policy or procedure, the grievant may appeal the decision to the board within five days of receiving the superintendent's response. (2) A hearing will be conducted pursuant to board policy 2500, Hearings Before the Board. (3) The board will provide a final written decision within 30 days of receiving the appeal unless further investigation is necessary or the hearing necessitates that more time be taken to respond. b. Discretionary Appeals Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1740/4010 Page 4 of 7 (1) If the grievant is dissatisfied with the superintendent\u2019s response to his/her grievance but has not alleged a violation of a specified federal or state law, federal or state regulation, State Board of Education policy or procedure or local board of education policy or procedure, within five days of receiving the superintendent\u2019s response, the grievant may submit to the superintendent a written request for a hearing before the board of education. (2) If the full board will be meeting within two weeks of the request for a hearing, the board will decide at that time whether to grant a hearing. Otherwise, the board chair shall appoint a three-person panel to review the request and determine if a hearing should be granted. The panel will report the decision to the board. The board may modify the decision of the panel upon majority vote at a board meeting. (3) If the board decides to grant a hearing, the hearing will be conducted pursuant to board policy 2500, Hearings Before the Board. (4) The board will provide a final written decision within 30 days of the decision to grant a hearing, unless further investigation is necessary or the hearing necessitates that more time be taken to respond. F. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 1. Discrimination on the Basis of Sex Sexual harassment complaint procedures are established in board policy 1745/4027. For other complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex, if the grievant is dissatisfied with the principal\u2019s written response, the grievance may be appealed to the Title IX coordinator. The Title IX coordinator will review the written documents and may conduct any factual inquiry and hold a conference as necessary to make a determination of whether there was discrimination on the basis of sex. The Title IX coordinator will provide a written response within 10 days of receiving the grievance unless additional time is necessary to complete any investigation. If the corrective steps involve actions outside of the scope of the Title IX coordinator\u2019s responsibilities, the superintendent or designee also will be notified so that responsibility for the corrective steps can be delegated to the appropriate individual. If still not satisfied, the student may appeal the Title IX coordinator's response to the superintendent and board as provided in this policy. (See also policy 1710/4021/7230 as it relates to the Title IX coordinator.) 2. Discrimination on the Basis of Disability If the student alleged discrimination on the basis of a handicapping condition or disability and the student is dissatisfied with the principal\u2019s written response, the grievance may then be appealed to the Section 504/Americans With Disabilities Act (\u201c504/ADA\u201d) coordinator. The 504/ADA coordinator will review the written Avery County Schools Policy Code: 1740/4010 Page 5 of 7 documents and may conduct any factual inquiry and hold a conference as necessary to make a determination of whether there was a discrimination on the basis of disability. The 504/ADA coordinator will provide a written response within 10 days of receiving the grievance unless additional time is necessary to complete any investigation. If the corrective steps involve actions outside the scope of the 504/ADA coordinator's responsibilities, the superintendent or designee also will be notified so that responsibility for the corrective steps can be delegated to the appropriate individual. If still not satisfied, the student may appeal the 504/ADA coordinator\u2019s response to the superintendent and board as provided in this policy. (See also policy 1710/4021/7230 as it relates to the 504/ADA coordinator.) 3. Appeal of Superintendent\u2019s Decision If a student wants to initiate a formal grievance in regard to a certain decision made by the superintendent that directly and specifically affects the student, the general process described in this policy will be used except the grievance will be submitted to the Director of Human Resources, who shall forward the grievance to the board chairperson. G. RECORDS Records of discrimination complaints will be maintained as required by 1710/4021/7230. H. NOTICE The superintendent or designee is responsible of providing effective notice to students, parents and school system employees of the procedures for reporting and investigating grievance.

The board encourages employees to report possible financial improprieties, ethical violations, and other illegal practices and intends that employees who report such matters in good faith will not be subject to retaliation or other employment consequences. If an employee reasonably believes that (1) there has been a violation of federal, state, or local law, policy, or regulation, public policy, or an individual\u2019s ethical duties and (2) the violation is due to a practice, policy, act, or omission of the board of education, an individual board member, a school system employee, or an entity/person with whom the school system has a business relationship, the employee should report that matter in accordance with policy 1750/7220, Grievance Procedure for Employees, or policy 1720/4015/7225, Discrimination, Harassment, and Bullying Complaint Procedure. Any complaint alleging a violation by the superintendent or the board should be filed with the board chair for investigation. The board chair will report the complaint to the board, and the board will authorize a prompt and thorough investigation or other action as necessary. The Avery County Board of Education forbids and will not tolerate any form of reprisal, retaliation or discrimination against any employee who, (1) in good faith, has made or intends to make a report of wrongdoing described in this policy; or (2) has refused to carry out a directive which may constitute a violation of federal, state, or local law, policy, or regulation, or (3) poses a substantial or specific danger to public health and safety. To be protected by this policy, employees who report violations or suspected violations must be acting in good faith based on a reasonable belief that the reported information represents an unlawful activity, policy, or practice. The protection extends to those employees whose allegations are made in good faith but prove to be mistaken. Further, except as otherwise required by law, the provisions of this policy apply only to those situations in which an employee brings the alleged unlawful activity, policy or practice to the attention of school officials or the board and provides school officials or the board with a reasonable opportunity to investigate and correct the alleged unlawful activity. If necessary, school officials or the board may specify reasonable steps to protect the complaining employee from reprisal.

An individual board member has no authority to act absent the delegation of authority by the board at an official meeting. As defined by law, an official meeting of the board includes any meeting, assembly or gathering together at any time or place or the simultaneous communication by conference telephone or other electronic means of a majority of the members of a public body for the purpose of conducting hearings, participating in deliberations, or voting upon or otherwise transacting the public business of the public body. However, a social meeting or other informal assembly or gathering together of the members of a public body does not constitute an official meeting unless called or held to evade the spirit and purposes of the open meetings law. A. TYPES OF MEETINGS While the board is determined to operate efficiently, it also is mindful of the importance of thoughtful planning and discussion prior to taking formal action. Regular meetings will be held at a predetermined time and place to conduct the business of the board. In addition, the board may hold specially-called meetings and emergency meetings as it deems necessary to act in a timely manner and provide its members and executive staff with the opportunity to have an exchange of ideas and receive input from other staff, parents, students and the community. B. REGULAR MEETINGS The superintendent will keep on file the schedule of regular meetings with the predetermined time and place. The schedule will be revised only in accordance with legal requirements for notice. C. EMERGENCY MEETINGS An emergency meeting may be called in order to address generally unexpected circumstances that require immediate consideration by the board. The chairperson, or the vice-chairperson, if the chairperson is unable or unwilling to act, or superintendent shall call an emergency meeting when it is determined that the meeting is necessary. D. SPECIALLY-CALLED MEETINGS 1. Specially-Called Meetings Generally Specially-called meetings may be scheduled in between regular meetings of the board. Work sessions, retreats, and public hearings are specific types of Avery County Schools Policy Code: 2300 Page 1 of 2 specially-called meetings. The board chairperson (or the vice-chairperson, if the chairperson is not available) or the superintendent may call special meetings when necessary to conduct business that cannot reasonably be handled at regular meetings. The board chairperson or superintendent shall call a special meeting if a majority of the members of the board so requests. 2. Retreats and Workshops Retreats and workshops are specially-called meetings that may be scheduled in order to give the board more time to deliberate or evaluate issues. Action may be taken at these meetings. 3. Public Hearings Public hearings are official proceedings during which members of the public are given an opportunity to be heard. Public hearings may be required by law or deemed advisable by the board. Public hearings that are not required by law may be scheduled when the chairperson or superintendent determines that the public hearing is advisable or when a majority of the members of the board so requests. Notice of all public hearings will be provided as required by law and will include subject, date, place and time of the hearing as well as any rules regarding participation, such as the length of time for each speaker. The purpose of a public hearing is to gather information and hear opinions from the community. Generally, board members will respond only to seek clarification. At the appointed time, the chairperson or designee shall call the hearing to order and preside over it in accordance with any rules regarding participation adopted by the board. When the allotted time expires or when no one wishes to speak, the chairperson or designee shall declare the hearing ended. E. OPEN MEETINGS LAW COMPLIANCE The board will comply with the open meeting law, including notice of meetings.

Interruption or interference with the orderly conduct of Board of Education business will not be allowed. The Board of Education chairperson or other presiding officer may Avery County Schools Policy Code: 2310 Page 1 of 2 terminate the speaker\u2019s privilege of address if, after being called to order, the speaker persists in improper conduct or remarks. 6. No person may present at a public meeting any charge or complaint against an individual employed by the Board of Education. Any such charge or complaint should be presented to the superintendent or the Board of Education in writing, signed by the complainant.

The Board reserves the right to modify the procedures described in this policy as necessary in any particular hearing in order to be fair, efficient, meet legal requirements or for any other reason the Board deems sufficient. A hearing will be open to the public unless a closed session is permitted by law. It is the express policy of the State and this Board to make hearings open to the public except for certain purposes specified in the Open Meetings Law. Grievance appeals pursuant to Board policies (Student and Parent Grievance Procedures, policy 1740/4010 and Grievance Procedure for Employees, policy 1750/7220 typically will be heard in closed sessions in order to present the disclosure of confidential information.

The superintendent is responsible for providing sufficient notice of the time and place a hearing will be held and the nature of the hearing that will be available. In order to resolve complaints expeditiously, board hearings will be scheduled as promptly as possible and notice given to the parties. The superintendent should provide as much notice as is feasible given the particular circumstances. The superintendent will provide a copy of this policy and, when possible, specify time limitations on the oral presentation if different from what is provided in section five of this policy. Individual hearings will be held unless the Board determines that a group hearing would be a more effective process for hearing and addressing the matter. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 2500 Page 1 of 3 When two or more individuals share the same or similar concern or are involved in the same matter to be heard by the Board, the Board may consider whether to conduct a group hearing. The Board may consider factors such as generally accepted standards of fairness, the need for efficiency and the ability to prevent the disclosure of confidential information. The Board will consider requests for group or individual hearings and will make the final determination. Unless otherwise required by law, the Board may designate a panel of two or more Board members to hear and act on behalf of the Board. The superintendent will confer with the chairperson of the Board to determine whether the full Board or a panel of the Board will conduct a hearing. The Board also may establish a panel to hear certain types of appeals, such as student grievances.

Written statements may be submitted at the hearing or in advance of the hearing unless otherwise specified. All parties will be given the opportunity to orally address the Board as well. The Board may establish time limitations for oral presentations for different types of hearings or may set the time limitation for a particular hearing. Unless a different time frame is established in the notice, applicable Board policies or at the hearing, each party will be offered 15 minutes to present his or her position to the Board. The Board may limit oral presentation to be made by the parties themselves: other witnesses may be excluded. Any individual intending to be represented by legal counsel must notify the superintendent in advance of the hearing.

The Board may consider any information that a reasonably prudent person would consider in conducting the serious affairs of a business. In reviewing any appeal of a decision of school personnel, the Board will determine whether the administrative record as a whole provides sufficient Avery County Schools Policy Code: 2500 Page 2 of 3 evidence to justify the decision of the superintendent. New evidence will not be permitted unless necessary to prevent a threat of substantial unfairness. The Board will review the administrative record, including any administrative proceedings, and will provide an opportunity for the superintendent and the party contesting the decision to a limited oral presentation of their positions. The submission of documentary evidence and presentation of additional witnesses will be allowed at the discretion of the Board. The superintendent is responsible for making a record of the hearing. The superintendent will make any record required by law. At a minimum, the Board record will incorporate the administrative record provided to the Board for review and any written documents submitted by the parties.

The board will provide an educational program that offers students the opportunity to receive a sound basic education. The program will meet statewide instructional standards as prescribed by the State Board of Education. The board believes that the administrators of the educational program also must strive to provide each student with the opportunity to: develop sufficient ability to read, write, and speak the English language and a sufficient knowledge of fundamental mathematics, and physical science to function in a complex and changing society; develop sufficient knowledge of geography, history, and basic economic and political systems to make informed choices with regard to issues that affect the student personally or affect the student\u2019s community, state, and nation; develop sufficient knowledge of geography, history, and basic economic and political systems to make informed choices with regard to issues that affect the student personally or affect the student\u2019s community, state, and nation; learn to be responsible for and accept the consequences of his or her conduct and academic performance; develop the capacity to examine and solve problems; foster respect and appreciation for cultural and ideological diversity and differences; Avery County Policy Code 3000 Page 1 of 2 7. develop the ability to be productive in a team environment; learn and acquire the skills necessary for a lifetime of continuous learning and adaptation to change in the workplace and society; prepare for challenging curriculum beyond secondary school and when possible, complete high school courses required for college entry in less than four years achieve high levels of success in a rigorous curriculum; acquire the skills needed for technological literacy in a rapidly changing world; and remain in school and earn a high school diploma and, when appropriate, earn additional college credit.

Prior to granting approval, the principal shall determine whether the course is eligible for credit toward graduation in accordance with the procedures and requirements developed by the superintendent. The parent or guardian of the student must give permission for the student to take the course and the student must complete any forms required by the school district. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3101 Page 1 of 2 Enrollment of a student in a course is the responsibility of the student and the student\u2019s parent or guardian. Unless otherwise provided, all special fees, charges and any special transportation needs are the responsibility of the student and the student\u2019s parent or guardian. For a student to receive credit toward high school graduation, the school at which the course is offered must provide such essential information as is generally included in official transcripts of school records. This information must include: (1) a description of the content and subject matter covered by the course; (2) the number of clock hours of instruction in the course; and (3) the student's achievement or performance level in the course. In addition, a syllabus which includes course goals, course objectives, course activities, and grade requirements must be provided. The student also must meet any other requirements established by the superintendent.

The progress of English learner (EL) students can be enhanced by effective and appropriate programs designed to meet their language needs. These programs shall be developed and implemented for English learner students within the guidelines and funding established by the North Carolina State Board of Education and the Department of Public Instruction. The English Learner Department of Avery County Schools strives to ensure that EL students have access to challenging content and receive appropriately modified instruction and assessments. EL services shall be delivered through both the English as a second language (ESL) program and the content area teacher. The EL department shall offer support and professional development to teachers and staff who work with English language learners. Identification of English Learner Students A home language survey will be included in the required initial enrollment packet provided to every new student enrolling in Avery County Schools. The principal or his or her designee shall notify the EL department within five (5) days after enrollment if a review of the home language survey reveals that the answer to any question is a language other than English. The EL department shall then assess the student\u2019s current level of English proficiency and determine if the student meets the criteria for EL classification. ESL specialists will collaborate with content area teachers to develop a personal education plan (PEP) for each EL student. The PEP will document the EL student\u2019s current English proficiency levels, language goals, classroom modifications, and eligibility for EL testing accommodations. Content area teachers shall implement the modifications and testing accommodations prescribed in the PEP. ESL specialists will meet with content area teachers during the year to review student needs and progress. Identification of Immigrant Students All children in the United States are entitled to equal access to a public education. Avery County Schools will not inquire about students\u2019 or parents\u2019 citizenship or immigration status. Avery County Schools may inquire about a student\u2019s country of birth for reporting purposes. The U.S. Department of Education allocates a portion of funding to states based on the share of immigrant children and youth in the state. The term \u201cimmigrant children and youth\u201d as defined in Section 3201(5) of Title III refers to individuals who: (A) are aged 3 through 21; (B) were not born in any state; and (C) have not been attending one or more schools in any one or more States (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) for more than three (3) full academic years. The term \u201cimmigrant\u201d as used in Title III is unrelated to an individual\u2019s legal or immigration status in the United States. Questions pertaining to a student\u2019s country of birth and date of first enrollment in any U.S. school are included on the Avery County Schools home language survey. The principal or his or her designee shall notify the EL department within five (5) days after enrollment if a review of a student\u2019s home language survey indicates that the student was born in a country other than the United States. The EL department shall determine if the student meets the criteria to be reported as an immigrant child or youth. Evaluating and Grading EL Students EL students will have access to challenging, grade-level content that will be modified to reduce complexity of language while preserving complexity of thought. However, EL students may not be expected to achieve the same outcomes in the same amount of time as their English- proficient peers. EL students may not receive a failing grade due to lack of English proficiency. Teachers should demonstrate that an EL student\u2019s poor academic performance is unrelated to language proficiency levels and is a result of factors unrelated to language, such as attendance, participation or effort, if a failing grade is to be assigned. Retention of EL Students EL students may not be retained for failing to meet academic standards due to language deficits. Retention of an EL student in grades K-8 or denial of credits in grades 9-12 may only be considered if academic difficulties are unrelated to English proficiency levels. EL specialists will participate in decisions concerning the retention of EL students. EL Students and Special Programs EL students shall not be referred to or excluded from specialized programs and support services (special education, programs for the academically gifted, etc.) because of English proficiency levels. Avery County Schools recognizes the challenges associated with making valid special education referrals and accurate special education placement decisions for EL students. EL specialists will be active participants in problem-solving and intervention processes prior to special education referrals. The problem-solving team will observe best practices and district protocol regarding EL students and the pre-referral process. Extrinsic factors such as English proficiency levels will be eliminated as primary contributors to a student\u2019s failure to make expected progress. Meaningful Communication with EL Parents Avery County Schools will promote the involvement of EL parents in the education of their children by providing equal access to information and effective, meaningful language assistance, when feasible. Avery County Schools will use the home language survey to inquire about whether a parent or guardian requires oral and/or written communication in a language other English. Limited English proficient parents will be provided with translation or interpretation services from appropriate and competent individuals. Students, siblings, friends, and untrained staff members are not considered qualified translators or interpreters, even if they are bilingual. Avery County Schools may use a language line phone service to provide oral interpretation services if interpreters who speak the target language are not available.

Materials also should be representative of the rich diversity of our nation and appropriate for the maturity levels and abilities of the students. For the purpose of this policy, instruction materials will be divided into two categories: textbooks and supplementary materials. A. SELECTION OF TEXTBOOKS Textbooks are systematically organized materials comprehensive enough to cover the primary objectives outlined in the current statewide instructional standards for a grade or course. Formats for textbooks may be print, non-print or digital media, including hardbound books, softbound book, activity-oriented programs, classroom kits and technology-based programs or materials that require the use of electronic equipment in order to used in the learning process. Sate-approved textbooks will be used as the primary means to help students meet the goals and objectives of the current statewide instructional standards, unless the board approves alternative materials. The central curriculum committee or a school through its school improvement plan may submit a request for the use of alternative textbooks. The request should identify how the committee or school has ensure that the curriculum will continue to be aligned with the current statewide instructional standards and to meet the educational goals of the board. B. SELECTION OF SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS Supplementary materials are instructional and learning resources which are selected to complement, enrich or extend the curriculum. Such resources include, for example, specialized materials selected to meet diverse needs or rapidly changing circumstances, library materials, digital resources, the school system\u2019s media collection classroom collections and teacher-selected resources for individual classes. 1. Objectives for Selection of Supplementary Materials The procurement of materials must be accomplished in accordance with law, including the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; board educational goals; board purchasing and accounting policies; and established selection guidelines, including the Library Bill of Rights of the American Library Association. The objectives for the selection of supplementary materials are as follows: Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3200 Page 1 of 4 a. to provide materials that will enrich and support the curriculum, taking into consideration the individual needs and varied interests, abilities, socio-economic backgrounds, learning styles and developmental levels of the pupils served; b. to provide materials that will stimulate growth in factual knowledge, literary appreciation, aesthetic values and ethical standards; c. to provide a background of information that will enable students to comprehend their role as citizens in society and to make intelligent judgments in their daily lives; d. to provide materials resources representing various points of view on controversial issues so that students as young citizens may develop, under guidance, the skills of critical thinking and critical analysis; e. to provide resources representative of the many religious, ethnic and cultural groups in our nation and the contributions of these groups to our American heritage; and f. to place principle above personal opinion and reason above prejudice in the selection of material of the highest quality in order to ensure a comprehensive collection appropriate for the users of the media center. 2. PROCESS AND CRITERIA FOR SELECTING SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS The responsibility for the selection of supplemental materials is delegated to the professional staff under the direction of the superintendent and will be made primarily at the school level with the involvement of an advisory committee. The committee shall be appointed by the principal and will include teachers and instructional support personnel representing various subject areas and grade levels, parents, and, if on-staff in the school the library media coordinator and the technology facilitator. . Students also should be involved when feasible. The selection process used by the committee will include: (1) an evaluation of the existing collection; (2) an assessment of the available resource and curriculum needs of the school; and (3) consideration of individual teaching and learning styles. In coordinating the selection of resources, the committee should use reputable, unbiased selection tools prepared by professional educators and should arrange, when possible, for firsthand examination of resources to be purchased. When examining proposed materials, the committee should consider the following factors: a. the material\u2019s educational significance and the contribution the subject matter will make to the curriculum and to the interests of the students; b. the material\u2019s reliability, including the extent to which it is accurate, authentic, authoritative, up-to-date, unbiased, comprehensive and well-balanced; Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3200 Page 2 of 4 c. the material\u2019s technical quality, including the extent to which technical components a are relevant to content and consistent with state-of-the-art capabilities: d. The possible uses of the material, including suitability for individual, small group large group, introduction, in-depth study, remediation and/or enrichment; e. the contribution the material will make to the collection\u2019s breadth and variety of viewpoints; f. the material\u2019s artistic, literary and physical quality and format; including its durability, manageability, clarity, appropriateness, skillfulness, organization and attractiveness; g. recommendations of school personnel and students from all relevant departments and grade levels; h. the reputation and significance of the material\u2019s author, producer and publisher; and i. the price of the material weighed against its value and/or the need for it. Materials Brought in by Teachers Principals will be responsible for establishing rules concerning what materials may be brought in by teachers without review. Principals are encouraged to involve teachers in establishing these rules. C. REMOVAL OF OUTDATED SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS To ensure that the supplementary media collection remains relevant, the media and technology professional, assisted by the media and technology advisory committee, shall review materials routinely to determine if any material is obsolete, outdated or irrelevant. The school media and technology advisory committee should remove materials no longer appropriate and replace lost, damaged and worn material still of educational value. Materials may be removed only for legitimate educational reasons and subject to the limitations of the First Amendment. The superintendent may establish regulations that provide additional standards for removing supplementary materials to meet the educational needs of the school system. Requests by parents to remove supplementary media materials due to an objection to the materials will be reviewed pursuant to policy 3210, Parental Inspection and Objection to Instructional Materials. D. ACCEPTANCE OF GIFT MATERIALS Supplementary materials offered as a gift will be reviewed pursuant to the criteria outlined in this policy, board policy 8220, Gifts and Bequests and any regulations established by the superintendent. Gift material may be accepted or rejected by the board based upon such criteria. E.

The Internet provides the school district the opportunity to better communicate with its communities by posting pertinent district and school information on the web. The Avery County School District has established its official district site on the web at http://www.averyschools.net/. In addition to this website, individual schools and departments may create school websites hosted on school district webservers and linked to the school district website. This policy provides the standards that must be followed for development of all district- related websites. Failure to comply with this policy may result in the prevention of posting a web page or in the removal of a web page or website from the Internet. A \u201cdistrict-related website\u201d is any Internet website that is established on district-provided web servers in at least one of the following ways: \u2022 by school district employees or students on behalf of the district; \u2022 by any school within the district; \u2022 by any school-sponsored club or organization within the district; or \u2022 through the use of school district equipment or the school district\u2019s access to the Internet. Only those websites that are created pursuant to this policy are considered district-related websites. The board does not endorse and is not responsible for websites created by employees, students or others outside the standards and guidelines of this policy. Students or employees who create personal websites that create a substantial and material disruption to the school environment may be subject to disciplinary action. STANDARDS FOR WEB PAGE DEVELOPMENT 1. Nonpublic or Closed Forums for Expression All district-related websites shall be \u201cnonpublic\u201d or \u201cclosed\u201d forums for expression. This means that the district has control over information on such web sites and is not required to allow students, faculty or others to place material on district-related web sites that the superintendent or his/her designee determines is inappropriate for any such website. The purpose of district-related websites is to disseminate curriculum-related information, to present the public with information about the district, its schools and programs and to provide the community with each school or department\u2019s mission, contact information, activities, organizational format and instructional program. District-related websites are analogous to newsletters from the administration or the individual school. District- related websites are not analogous to a student newspaper or non-school publication. 2. Administration and Editorial Control Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3227/7322 Page 1 of 4 All staff members responsible for creating, developing, maintaining, editing or approving a district-related website will behave legally, responsibly and ethically in providing educational resources and information to support the mission and curriculum of the school district. Such persons will abide by the generally accepted rules of website etiquette, board policy, procedures and guidelines established by the superintendent. a. Superintendent Final Authority The board delegates to the superintendent, administrative staff, principals, teachers and web managers the authority to place information on district-related websites. The superintendent or his/her designee has final authority to approve or disapprove any information in whatever form on such websites. b. School District Official Website The superintendent or his/her designee will have editorial control and responsibility for the content of the school district official website. The superintendent will appoint a staff member to serve as the web manager/editor of the district website. c. Individual School Websites The school district will provide each school with a web address, web design software and disk space on district-provided web servers. All district-related websites will be housed on district-provided web servers. Each principal will have editorial control and responsibility for the content of the individual school\u2019s official website, subject to review of the superintendent or his/her designee. The principal will appoint a staff member to serve as the web manager of the school\u2019s website and a website committee to advise the web manager and principal regarding the content of the school\u2019s website. Individual school websites must comply with the additional guidelines provided below. d. Teacher and Student Websites Each teacher will have editorial control and responsibility for the content of his/her official website and for the content of his/her students\u2019 websites, subject to the review by the principal, the superintendent and the board. Upon the knowledge and written consent of a student\u2019s parent or guardian, a teacher may allow a student to create a website within or linked from a school\u2019s or teacher\u2019s website only for the following instructional purposes: (1) to teach a student how to create or maintain a website or (2) to facilitate a student\u2019s work on school assignments or research projects. No student pages will be posted or made accessible to the general public until approved by the principal or his/her designee. e. Personal Websites Personal and non-district-related websites shall not be posted or published on district web servers. All employees are required to use the Avery County Schools' district network when creating websites for any and all educational and work related positions or communications with students. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3227/7322 Page 2 of 4 When creating or posting material to a webpage or other internet sites apart from ACSNet, employees should remember that the content may be viewed by anyone, including community members, students and parents. Employees are to maintain an appropriate relationship with students at all times. Having a public personal website or online networking profile or allowing access to a private website or private online networking profile is considered a form of direct communications with students. Employees are asked to block students from viewing any material or profiles that are not age appropriate. Any employee found to have created and/or posted inappropriate content on a website or profile that has a negative impact on the employee's ability to perform their job as it relates to working with students will be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal. This section applies to all employees, volunteers and student teachers working for or in the Avery County School System. The school district is not responsible for personal websites or web pages created or maintained outside of the district by students, personnel, parents, groups or organizations. Personal websites or web pages are not considered district-related websites or web pages, and are not covered by the provisions of this policy. The superintendent may use any means available to request the removal of personal websites that substantially disrupt the school environment or that utilize school district or individual school names, logos or trademarks without permission. 3. Copyright Laws Websites must comply with all copyright laws and board policy 3230/7330, Copyright Compliance. Copyright permission must be obtained for the use of any copyrighted material. The superintendent or designee and each principal or designee will ensure that all permission for use of copyrighted work or release of information is maintained in a safe place. 4. Behavior Standards When using the Internet, staff and students are responsible for understanding and complying with board policies and administrative regulations, including policy 3225/7320 (ACSNet Acceptable Use Policy), the 4300 section policies (Student Behavior Policies) and policy 7300 (Staff Responsibilities).

The board also recognizes that the school day and school year should be planned in a manner to facilitate student learning and to permit an accurate assessment of student achievement in scheduled testing periods. A. INSTRUCTIONAL TIME Interruptions of instructional time and time off task must be kept to a minimum. The principal is responsible for ensuring that instructional time is maintained and protected in the school schedule. Each teacher is responsible for ensuring optimal use of instructional time in his or her classes. Schools personnel are encouraged to seek creative means of reducing transitional time and scheduling non-instructional activities. A proposal for alternative scheduling of classes or other such strategies may be a part of a school improvement plan. B. SCHOOL DAY The length of the school day may vary from school to school if approved by the board of education. The \u201cinstructional\u201d day includes only those hours a student is assigned to a teacher for the primary purpose of instruction. Breaks in the instructional day for changing classes, homeroom, lunch, pep rallies and similar non-instructional activities are not part of the instructional day and may not be counted towards the minimum instructional hours requirement established in Section D, below. C. OPENING AND CLOSING DATES Except for year-round schools or schools operating under a modified calendar, the opening date for students will be no earlier than the Monday closest to August 26, and the closing date for students will be no later than the Friday closest to June 11. The school board may offer supplemental or additional educational programs or activities outside the adopted school calendar. Upon a showing of good cause, as defined by G.S. 115C-84.2(d), the board will seek a waiver of the opening dates from the State Board of Education. The board will revise the closing date only if necessary to comply with the minimum requirements for instructional days or instructional time. D. SCHOOL CALENDAR The school calendar in all schools will be for 215 days and will provide a minimum of 185 days or 1025 hours of instruction covering at least nine months. A school \u201cmonth\u201d is defined as 20 days of instruction. If school is closed early due to inclement weather, the day and the number of instructional hours originally scheduled may count towards the Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3300 Page 1 of 3 required minimum number of instructional days or hours. As funding permits, the board may pursue increasing the number of instructional hours or days, at least for those students who need more time to learn the curriculum. The board may initiate or review recommendations from the superintendent or a school improvement team for modifying the traditional school calendar to a year-round calendar. The superintendent and individual schools are encouraged to obtain input from teachers and other personnel as well as from the community in developing proposals for modifying the school calendar. A year-round school may be included as a part of a school improvement plan. Any calendar adoped by the board will be consistent with the following requirements. 1. The calendar will consist of 215 days and shall meet state requirements for the minimum instructional days and/or the minimum instructional hours. 2. At least 10 of the days on the calendar will be designated as annual vacation leave days. 3. The calendar will include the same or an equivalent number of legal holidays as those designated by the Human Resources Commission for State employees, including Veteran\u2019s Day if it falls on a weekday. 4. School will not be scheduled on Sundays. 5. The total number of workdays for teachers employed for a 10-month term will not exceed 195 days. 6. The calendar will designate \u201cinstructional\u201d days, when students must be present. 7. The remaining days will be scheduled by the board, in consultation with school principals, as \u201cflexible\u201d days, for use as teacher workdays, additional instructional days or other lawful purposes. Before scheduling these \u201cflexible\u201d days, each principal shall work with the school improvement team to determine the days to be scheduled and the purposes for which they should be scheduled. 8. Of the \u201cflexible\u201d days described in subsection D.7, the board will designate at least two days as protected days on which teachers may take accumulated vacation leave. All other \u201cflexible\u201d days may be designated as days on which teachers may take accumulated leave, but the board will give teachers at least 14 calendar days notice before requiring a teacher to work instead of taking vacation leave on any of these days. A teacher may elect to waive this notice requirement for one or more of these days. 9. The board may, due to school closings because of inclement weather or other reasons, use any of the \u201cflexible\u201d days designated in subsection D.7 Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3300 Page 2 of 3 above as make-up days for those instructional days that were missed. If necessary, these make-up days may be scheduled after the last day of student attendance. If either of the two protected days described in subsection D.8 above are scheduled as a make-up day, teachers may take accumulated vacation leave on the make-up day and will not be required to work. 10. If the school calendar requires students to attend on Memorial Day, each principal shall ensure that students are instructed on the significance of Memorial Day on that day. If students are not scheduled to attend school on Memorial Day, instruction on the significance of Memorial Day will be provided at another time. 11. If the school calendar requires students to attend school on September 17, which is Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, each principal shall ensure that an educational program about the United States Constitution is held in the school on that day. If students are not required to attend school on September 17, the principal shall ensure that such a program is held during the week preceding or following Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.

Field trip participants are required to ride on approved transportation at all times. School employees may not take their children out of school to attend field trips. Parents who wish to participate in the field trip but do not want their child to ride on school approved transportation may do so, but students will be counted absent and not officially part of the field trip. This applies only to parents and their children. Students who have exhibited behavior that would endanger the safety of himself/herself or others, or has been a discipline problem on previous field trips, may be excluded from future field trips by the principal. In such cases, the student will be provided an alternative educational placement at the school for the day of the Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3320 Page 1 of 3 field trip. An alternative assignment will be given to cover the curricular objectives for the day. 14. The following additional regulations will apply to overnight trips: a. A written request for approval must be submitted to the board in a sufficient length of time to plan adequately for the trip. Requests for trips that are repeated from year to year require annual approval by the Board of Education. Accompanying the request will be a tentative schedule and itinerary as well as rationale outlining the trip's curriculum connection. A final schedule and detailed itinerary must be presented to the superintendent one month in advance of the trip. b. In the event that the cost of the trip necessitates fund-raising, the trip must be approved by the board of education prior to the initiation of any fund-raising efforts. In addition, the fund-raising efforts should be in alignment with board policy 3321. c. Special insurance will be purchased to cover each person on the trip. d. Field trips requiring students to miss more than three (3) consecutive school days are to be discouraged. e. Each parent will be given information on how to access financial assistance via appendix 3320.B. 14. A bus passenger list that accurately reflects both students and chaperones participating in the trip, along with emergency contact numbers, must be submitted to the Central Office before the trip.

The Avery County Board of Education believes that the formal issuance of student evaluations on a regular basis promotes continuous assessment of a student\u2019s performance; informs the student, his or her parents or guardians, and the guidance counselor about the student\u2019s performance and progress; and provides a system of notice which allows intervention strategies to be implemented if necessary to improve the student\u2019s performance. The board encourages teachers and principals to pursue innovative methods of evaluating progress. An evaluation system will be established for assessing an individual student\u2019s academic achievement and progress relative to benchmarks set for students at that instructional level (e.g. periodic assessment for expected growth). The evaluation system should provide for regular communication with parents so that they may be informed and involved in their child\u2019s education. The board requires regular contact with parents by school personnel for commendation as well as for notification of concerns. Schools will plan for periodic communications with parents in the following manner: Interim Reports: Notification Concerning Class Grades 1. All middle and high school teachers are required to send interim reports to all students at the mid-point of each grading period. 2. All elementary regular classroom teachers and \u201cteachers of record\u201d for academic classes are required to send interim reports to all students. Special teachers (i.e. art, music, P. E., library, computer, guidance, etc.) are required to send interim reports if a student has had a drop in behavior or performance. 3. If the report indicates a student has had a drop in grade or may not pass the grading period, then Interim Reports must be signed by the parent and returned to the teacher. If the teacher does not receive the signed document from the parent, it is the teacher\u2019s responsibility to call or meet with the parent and document that conversation. 4. Teachers may offer rewards (such as a point added to a final average) for the student returning the interim report. However, punishment may not be used. Notification Concerning Repeating a Grade or a Course 1. If any student is not making satisfactory progress toward promotion or passing the End-of Grade/End \u2013of-Class exam, parents must be notified at the mid-year (elementary and middle school) or mid-semester (high school). This communication must be confirmed by signature of the parent, and/or documented meetings. Notification Concerning High School Graduation Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3400 Page 1 of 2 1. If a student may not graduate on time, parents must be notified in person or by certified mail by mid-semester, or as soon as a teacher becomes aware of the problem. Teachers will be responsible for evaluating student performance and keeping accurate records in order to substantiate a grade or assessment given in a course.

To realize this goal, students who are at risk of academic failure and who are not successfully progressing toward grade promotion and graduation must be identified and provided additional assistance. The principal or designee is responsible for ensuring that teachers identify students at risk and that the school improvement team develops a plan to include successful transition between grade spans for such students in compliance with G.S. 115C-105.41. A. IDENTIFICATION OF AND ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS AT RISK The superintendent shall organize available resources to implement a multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) that uses data-driven problem-solving and research- based instructional practices for all students. The superintendent shall establish processes and standards for addressing concerns about student performance and for documenting student responses to research-based instruction and interventions within the MTSS. Using information about the student\u2019s response to instruction and/or interventions and other student performance data, school personnel must identify students at risk of academic failure as early as reasonably may be done beginning in kindergarten. School administrators and teachers shall address the needs of students identified as at risk of academic failure through the supports available in the MTSS and/or other processes established by the superintendent. The parents or guardians of such students should be included, through oral or written communication or other means, in the implementation and review of academic and/or behavioral interventions for their children. B. Transition Plans Transitions in the school environment can be stressful experiences that pose academic, social and emotional challenges for students. Addressing students\u2019 academic, social and emotional needs to create successful transitions provides students with a better chance of academic success. A comprehensive and coordinated transition plan will be implemented for students who are at risk of academic failure in order to facilitate their educational transitions between elementary school and middle school and between middle school and high school. The superintendent shall appoint a transition team to design, implement and evaluate a school system transition plan. This team will be comprised of stakeholders who can identify the needs of students at the different developmental levels and implement plans that produce positive results for students at risk of Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3405 Page 1 of 2 academic failure. Such stakeholders may include principals, teachers, support staff and other school system employees, parents of students in the school system, and local business and community leaders such as civic group leaders, health department personnel, preschool and Head Start program personnel, faith community leaders, and personnel from local colleges, universities and community colleges. At each school, the school improvement team shall use the school system transition plan to design a school-based transition plan tailored to meet the specific needs of that school\u2019s population. The transition plan may be included in the school improvement plan. See policy 3430, School Improvement Plan. The transition plans should be designed to encourage successful transitions that foster respect for individual differences, encourage understanding of the whole child, create a sense of trust and belonging, and reduce child and family anxiety about school. The plans must include an on-going evaluation process to verify that the outcomes established for the different transition levels are being accomplished and that these goals are updated as student data and environmental changes occur.

A testing program also assists in the continued refinement of the instructional program. In addition, data from tests and assessments provide measures of student learning that are useful for evaluating educator effectiveness. Every effort will be made to ensure that the testing program contributes to the learning process rather than detracts from it. Efforts also will be made to ensure culture free or culture-fair tests in order to ensure that measurements are reasonably accurate. A. ADMINISTRATION OF TESTS, SCREENINGS, AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS The superintendent shall provide for the proper administration of all state-required tests, screenings, and other assessments, and any state- required remedial instruction and/or retesting in accordance with all requirements established by law or the State Board of Education. The superintendent, in consultation with the school principals, shall determine how results from such measures will be used on determining students\u2019 final grades, provided that the requirements described in Section B, below, and any other applicable state requirements are met. The superintendent shall provide for the online administration of state-required tests to the extent required by the State Board of Education or the Department of Public Instruction, and otherwise as feasible within available resources. The superintendent shall keep the board informed of any resources or other measures needed to support online test administration. Students may participate in field-testing and other sample testing as designated by the State Board or the Department of Public Instruction. The superintendent shall develop security and administration procedures for the state testing program and other assessments that are consistent with State Board of Education requirements and relevant law. The superintendent shall ensure that all relevant personnel are instructed in such testing procedures. All testing personnel, teachers and school administrators are required to be familiar with and adhere to all applicable testing manuals, handbooks, and guides, including the Testing Code of Ethics, for state tests and locally-required. Failure to follow procedures may result in disciplinary sanctions, including termination or revocation of administrative and/or teaching licenses. B. HIGH SCHOOL FINAL EXAMS AND END-OF-COURSE TESTING High school students must take all end-of-course (EOC) tests, NC Final Exams, and Career and Technical Education State Assessments (CTE Post-Assessments) required by the State Board of Education. For all students, including English Learner students in their first year in a U.S. school and students following the Occupational Course of Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3410 Page 1 of 3 Study Pathway, the results of EOC tests, NC Final Exams, and CTE Post- Assessments will count as 20 percent of a student\u2019s final grade in each high school course for which there is an EOC test, NC Final Exam, or CTE Post-Assessment. However, the results of such assessments will not factor into a student\u2019s final grade in a course during the initial implementation year of a new assessment for that course where scores are not immediately available due to standard setting. C. MINIMIZING TIME SPENT TESTING The superintendent or designee shall ensure that the time that students spend taking standardized state and local tests is minimized and the frequency of field testing at a particular standardized state and local tests is minimized and the frequency of field testing at a particular school are minimized. Specifically, the superintendent shall ensure the following: Schools will devote no more than two days of instructional time per year to the taking of practice tests that do not have the primary purpose of assessing current student learning. Students will not be subject to field tests or national tests during the two-week period preceding their school\u2019s administration of end-of-grade tests, end-of-course tests, or regularly scheduled final exams. No school will participate in more than two field tests at any one grade level during a school year. All annual assessments of student achievement adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to G.S. 115C-174.11(c)(1) or other applicable law and all final exams for courses will be administered within the final ten instructional days of the school year for year-long courses and within the final five instructional days of the semester for semester courses. Exceptions will be permitted on an individual basis to accommodate a student\u2019s individualized education program or Section 504 plans; for the administration of final exams for courses with national or international curricula required to be held at designated times; for make-up testing; and as otherwise permitted by the Department of Public Instruction. Extra-Curricular activities will not be scheduled the evening before a final exam unless it is a state, regional, or conference activity.

PURPOSE The Avery County Schools Board of Education believes that students should progress to the next level of study only after they are proficient in their knowledge and application of the current curriculum level. To the extent reasonably possible, students should be given as much time or as little time as they need to be proficient at a particular level of study. Students will be promoted to the next level of study as described in this policy. B. STUDENT PROMOTION STANDARDS The superintendent shall develop (1) proposed promotion standards and (2) a process to be used determining a student's readiness to progress to the next level of study and shall submit the standards and process to the board for approval. The standards will be based, in part, upon proficiency in reading. The standards and process must provide multiple criteria for assessing a student's readiness to progress to the next level of study, such as standardized test scores, formative and diagnostic assessments, grades, a portfolio or anthology of the student's work, and, when appropriate, accepted standards for assessing developmental growth. The standards and process will incorporate all state law and State Board of Education policy requirements, including those for the assessment and promotion of third grade students as described in G.S. 115C-83.6 et seq. and State Board of Education Policies KNEC-002 and -003. Principals shall ensure that the promotion standards are used by teachers and school administrators in assessing each student\u2019s readiness to progress to the next level of study. Principals have the authority to promote or retain students based upon the standards approved by the board and any applicable standards set by the State Board of Education. To reduce the number of students who do not meet promotion standards, the board directs school administrators and teachers to address the needs of students who not making adequate academic progress as required by policy 3405, Students at Risk of Academic Failure. C. DIPLOMA STANDARDS To receive a North Carolina high school diploma, students must complete the requirements set forth in policy 3460, Graduation Requirements. D. APPEALS OF PROMOTION DECISIONS 1. Appeal to the Superintendent Within 5 workdays of receiving the principal\u2019s written decision to promote or retain a student, the student\u2019s parents may appeal the decision to the superintendent. The superintendent may overturn the principal\u2019s decision only upon a finding that the principal's decision was arbitrary and capricious (i.e., without a rational basis) or otherwise an abuse of discretion. 1 The superintendent must render a decision within 10 workdays of receiving the appeal. The superintendent may support the principal\u2019s decision, remand it back to the principal for consideration of additional issues, or reverse the decision. The superintendent\u2019s findings must be in writing and must be provided to the parents. 2. Appeal to the Board of Education The superintendent's decision to promote or retain a student may be appealed to the board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection E.5 of policy 1740/4010, Student and Parent Grievance Procedures. E. READING CAMPS The board will provide reading camp opportunities as required by law at no fee for students who have not yet demonstrated reading proficiency on a third-grade level at the end of the student\u2019s third grade year and for first and second grade studetns whose demonstrated reading comprehension is below grade level. The superintendent or designee shall encourage parents of eligible student to enroll their students in a reading camp. To the extent resources permit, the board will offer fee-based reading camp opportunities to students who have successfully demonstrated reading proficiency appropriate for a third-grade student and to first and second grade students who have demonstrated appropriate developmental abilities in reading comprehension. Annually, the board will establish criteria for priority enrollment in its fee- based reading camps and will set the attendance fee at an amount not to exceed the statutory limit. The superintendent or designee shall notify interested parents of the application procedure for the fee-based reading camps. F. PROMOTION STANDARDS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES To the extent possible, students with disabilities must be held to the same promotion standards as all other students. However, for students who take alternative assessments in lieu of the end- of-grade (EOG) or the end-of-course (EOC) tests, promotion decisions must be based on criteria recommended by the IEP team. All intervention strategies and other opportunities, benefits and resources that are made available to students without disabilities must be made available to those students with disabilities who are subject to the student promotion standards. Such opportunities must be in addition to the special education services provided to the student. G. CREDIT BY DEMONSTRATED MASTERY Beginning with the 2014-2015- school year, the superintendent shall provide opportunities for students in grades 9 through 12 to earn course credit by demonstrating mastery of course material without first completing the regular period of classroom instruction in the course. Students in grades 6 through 8 may earn credit be demonstrated mastery for high school courses offered in middle school. To earn credit by demonstrated mastery, students must demonstrate a deep understanding of the content standards and application of knowledge through a multi-phase assessment, in accordance with standards established by the State Board of Education and any additional standards established by the superintendent. H. CREDIT RECOVERY Students who fail a high school course may retake parts of the course through credit recovery to 2 earn credit for the course. Credit recovery delivers a subset of the blueprint of the original course in order to specifically address deficiencies in a student\u2019s mastery of the course and target specific components of a course necessary for completion. A pre-assessment of the student\u2019s understanding of the course material will be administered at the beginning of the course and the credit recovery will be tailored to meet the needs of the individual student. The length of a credit recovery course is dictated by the skills and knowledge the student needs to recover and not a fixed length of seat time. Any EOC exam associated with the credit recovery course will be administered no later than 30 days upon completion of the credit recovery course. The credit recovery will be graded as pass or fail and will not impact the student\u2019s grade point average. The original grade for the course will remain on the student\u2019s transcript. The superintendent shall develop procedures addressing the implementation of credit recovery opportunities across the school system. I. REPEATING A COURSE FOR CREDIT 1. Repeating a Previously Failed Course As provided in State Board of Education policy CCRE-001, high school students who fail a course for credit may repeat that course. To take advantage of this option, the student must repeat the entire course. When a student initially fails a high school course and successfully repeats the course for credit, the new course grade will replace the original failing grade for the course on the student\u2019s transcript and in calculations of the student\u2019s GPA, class rank, and honor roll eligibility. The superintendent may develop procedures for students to indicate their intent to repeat a course for credit under this paragraph and may establish any other rules as necessary and consistent with State Board policy. 2. Repeating a Course for which Credit was Earned (Grade Replacement) The board recognizes that high school students may need to repeat a course for which they have earned credit in order to increase their understanding of the course content, to improve skill mastery, or to meet postsecondary goals. Students may repeat a course for which they have previously earned credit, subject to the following preconditions and any other reasonable rules established by the superintendent. a. the student must have earned a letter grade of C or lower in the course on the first attempt; b. the students must make a written request to repeat the grade; c. the principal or designee must approve the request; d. there must be space available after seats have been assigned to students who are taking the course for the first time or repeating a previously failed course; e. the course to be repeated must be a duplicate of the original class and must be taken during the regular school day at a high school in this school system or through the North Carolina Virtual Public School; f. upon completion of the repeated course, the new course grade will replace the student\u2019s original grade on the student\u2019s transcript and in calculations of the student\u2019s grades, GPA, class rank, and honor roll eligibility, regardless of whether the later grade is higher or lower than the students\u2019 original mark; g. credit towards graduation for the same course will be given only once; h. a course may be repeated only one time; i. students may repeat a maximum of four previously passed courses during their high school 3 careers. The superintendent shall require notice to students and parents of these preconditions and of any other relevant information deemed advisable by the superintendent. J. ACCELERATION Some students may need less time to learn the curriculum. Teachers are encouraged to challenge these students by expanding the curriculum, providing opportunities to explore subjects in greater detail or providing different types of educational experiences. To challenge a student sufficiently, the principal may reassign the student to a different class or level of study and/or may identify concurrent enrollment or other curriculum expansion options (Policy 3101, Dual Enrollment). The principal, after consulting with the professional staff and the student's parents, may determine that skipping a grade level is appropriate. K. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 1. Superintendent\u2019s Report to the Board At least on an annual basis, the superintendent will provide board with the following information for each school: a. Aggregate student performance scores on state-mandated tests and any other standardized tests used by a school or the school district; b. The number and percentage of students retained and/or not meeting standards for their grade level; c. The number and percentage of third grade students exempt from mandatory third grade retention by category of exemption as listed in state laws; and d. Remedial or additional educational opportunities provided by the school district and the success of these efforts in helping students to meet promotion standards. 2. Report to North Carolina State Board of Education and Department of Public Instruction Pursuant to statutory requirements and standards established by the Department of Public Instruction, all required information regarding student performance will be provided annually to the State Board of Education and the Department of Public Instruction. 3. Publication on the School System Website Information about the reading performance of third grade students will be posted on the school system website in accordance with state law. L. RESOURCES Consistent with the objective of improving student performance, the board will provide maximum flexibility to schools in the allocation of state funds. Schools personnel are expected to budget financial resources in a manner which will meet the standards established in this policy. The board will consider requests to transfer funds from other funding allotment categories to intervention strategies as a part of the school improvement plan submitted by a school. All funds will be used in a fiscally sound manner in accordance with board policy 8300 (Fiscal Management Standards). 4 M. NOTIFICATION TO PARENTS The superintendent or designee shall provide information regarding promotion standard to all students and parents. In addition, if a kindergarten, first grade, second grade or third grade student (1) is demonstrating difficulty with reading development, or (2) is not reading at grade level, the student\u2019s teacher shall provide the student\u2019s parents timely written notice advising that if the student is not demonstrating reading proficiency by the end of third grade, the student will be retained, unless exempt from mandatory retention for good cause. Parents are encouraged to help their children meet the promotion standards and will have opportunities to discuss the promotion standards and procedures with teachers and the principal. Information provided to parents should be in the parents' native language when appropriate foreign language resources are readily available. The teacher of a student who does not meet promotion standards must notify the student's parents that the student has failed to meet the standards for progression to the next level of study and must provide the parents with information concerning retesting, intervention, review and appeal opportunities. When a student is to be retained, the principal shall provide the student\u2019s parents written notice of the retention and, if the student will be retained in accordance with G.S. 115C-83.7(a) for failure to demonstrate reading proficiency, (1) written notice of the reason the student is not eligible for a good cause exemption as provided in G.S. 115C-83.7(b) and (2) a description of proposed reading interventions that will be provided to the student to remediate identified areas of reading deficiency. Teachers shall provide parents of students retained under G.S. 115C-83.7(a) at least monthly written reports on student progress toward reading proficiency. The evaluation of a student\u2019s progress will be based upon the student\u2019s classroom work, observations, tests, assessments and other relevant information. N. CHILDREN OF MILITARY FAMILIES As required by the Interstate Compact on Education Opportunity for Military children (G.S. 115C-407.5) and policy 4155, Assignment to Classes, school administrators have the authority to exercise flexibility in waiving course or program prerequisites or other preconditions for the placement of children of military families in courses or program offered by the school system.

The board also recognizes other means of evaluating student achievement, including grade point average, courses completed, the rigorousness of the curriculum, results of tests and assessments and recommendation letters. High schools shall provide for the compilation of class rankings to be listed on student transcripts and may make class rank information available periodically to students and their parents or guardians, and to other institutions at the request of the student or the student\u2019s parents or guardians. While high school principals may designate a valedictorian and salutatorian, the board encourages principals, with input from teachers, parents and students, to develop alternative or additional means of recognizing academic achievements. Principals will ensure that class ranking is computed in a fair and consistent manner as provided in State Board of Education Policy GCS-L-004. The superintendent and principal shall ensure that students and parents receive adequate notice as to how class rank is calculated and shall provide written procedures on how students with equal grades, or grades that may be perceived as equal, will be treated. Nothing in this policy provides a student with any legal entitlement to a particular class rank or title. Although the student grievance procedure provided in policy 1740/4010, Student and Parent Grievance Procedure, may be utilized to resolve disputes formally, the board encourages parents, students and principals to reach a resolution informally on any matters related to class rank.

In order to graduate from high school, students will be required to meet the minimum requirements: 1. successful completion of all course unit requirements mandated by the State Board of Education (see Section A); 2. beginning in the 2014-2015 school year, successful completion of cardiopulmonary resuscitation instruction; and 3. successful completion of all other requirements mandated by the board, as provided in this policy. The principal shall ensure that parents and students are aware of all graduation requirements. Guidance program staff shall assist students in selecting their high school courses to ensure that students are taking all of the required units and selecting electives consistent with their post-graduation plans. For students who have transferred to the school district during high school, or who for other reasons have completed course work outside of the school district, the principal will determine what course work will be applied as credit for graduation. The principal shall consider the requirements of the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunities for Military Children (G.S. 115C-407.5) and the requirements of subsection C.3 of this policy in determining the graduation requirements for children of military families. A. COURSE UNITS REQUIRED Each student must meet the course unit requirements for one of the following courses of study. Students entering the ninth grade for the first time in the 2009-2010 school year must fulfill the requirements of the Future-Ready Occupational Course of Study. Course unit requirements for the Future-Ready Core Course of Study differ depending on the year a student enters ninth grade for the first time, as set out in the table below. In accordance with policy 3101, Dual Enrollment, and State Board of Education requirements, students may earn high school credit for college courses completed. In addition, students may earn credit for certain high school courses in the Future-Ready Core Course of Study completed while in middle school, as authorized by the State Board of Education. Students also have the opportunity to meet course unit requirements without completing the regular period of classroom instruction by demonstrating mastery of the course material in accordance with policy 3420, Student Promotion and Accountability, and State Board of Education requirements. All awards of high school course credit must be consistent with State Board of Education requirements. Any inconsistency between board policy and State Board graduation requirements will be resolved by following the State Board requirements. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3460 Page 1 of 4 1.

Students with Disabilities Graduation requirements must be applied to students with disabilities to the extent required by state and federal law and State Board policy. Children of Military Families In order to facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, the board adopts the following policy provisions for students covered by the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children. a. Waiver Requirements Specific course work required for graduation will be waived if similar course work has been satisfactorily completed in another school system. If a waiver is not granted, school administrators shall provide the student with reasonable justification for the denial. If a waiver is not granted to a student who would qualify to graduate from the sending school, the superintendent or designee shall provide the student with an alternative means of acquiring the required coursework so that graduation may occur on time. b. Testing Requirements for Graduation The superintendent shall accept the following in lieu of any local testing requirements for graduation: (1) end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state; (2) national norm-referenced achievement tests; or (3) alternative testing.

The comprehensive health education program provided by the school system will meet the requirements of state law and the objectives established by the State Board of Education. The board may, in its discretion, expand on the subject areas to be included in the program and on the instruction objectives to be met. A. COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM A comprehensive health education program will be taught to students from kindergarten through ninth grade. As required by law, the program must include age appropriate instruction on bicycle safety, nutrition, dental health, environmental health, family living, consumer health, disease control, growth and development, first aid and emergency care, mental and emotional health, drug and alcohol abuse prevention, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (\u201cSTDS\u201d), including HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, and reproductive health and safety education.

B. USE AND ALLOCATION OF TITLE I FUNDS Title I funds will be used to supplement, and not to supplant, non-federal funds that would otherwise be used for the education of students participating in the Title I program. Accordingly, state and local funds will be allocated to each school receiving Title I funds in a manner that ensures that each such school receives all of the state and local funds it would otherwise receive in the absence of Title I funding. C. COMPARABILITY OF SERVICES State and local funds will be used in schools receiving Title I funds to provide services that, taken as a whole, are at least comparable to services in schools that are not receiving Title I funds, or, if all schools receive Title I funds, to provide services that are substantially comparable in each school. The board will ensure equivalence among schools in the allocation of state and local resources for (1) teachers, administrators, and other staff, and (2) curriculum materials and instructional supplies. In addition, the board will establish and implement system-wide salary scales that are applicable to all staff whether assigned to Title I or non-Title I schools. D. COMPARABILITY TESTING The superintendent shall direct the Title I coordinator, in conjunction with the finance officer, to conduct comparability testing before November 1 of each school year to assess the equivalent distribution of state and local resources among schools, using forms, measures, methodologies, and other guidance as specified by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) for the calculation of comparability. Schools may be examined on either a grade-span or school-by-school basis. The superintendent or designee shall submit the comparability testing report annually to NCDPI by the deadline established by that agency. E. CORRECTION OF NONCOMPLIANCE If comparability testing identifies any instances of variance greater than 10%, the Title I Page 1 of 2 Policy Code: 3565/8307 coordinator shall notify the superintendent or designee without delay. The superintendent or designee shall promptly make adjustments as needed to ensure comparability.

Each school is directed to develop a counseling program that will meet the needs of the student population at that school with the objective of improving student performance. School guidance counselors and other guiding adults in middle and high schools will provide guidance and information to students about course selections and requirements prior to ninth grade, in order to inform them about accelerated preparation for college entry. Guidance counselors will encourage ninth grade students to complete theses requirements in less than four years where feasible and appropriate. The counseling program should operate in collaboration with teachers and others involved in educating students, including those who assist children with special needs or students who are at risk of dropping out of school or not meeting performance expectations. Input from parents and students should be sought in accordance with the school's plan for involvement of the community in school programs. All schools must follow the Parental Involvement Plan (policy 1310/4002) in regard to parental notification/permission for counseling programs. In addition, school personnel shall annually provide all students in Grades 9 through 12 with information on the manner in which a parent may lawfully abandon a newborn baby with a responsible person, in accordance with G.S. 7B-500. Counseling may be provided on an individual basis or in small or large groups. School counselors may refer students who have extensive needs or needs that go beyond the purpose of the counseling program to community resources. Students may seek counseling or be referred by staff or parents. Any staff member who is aware that a student is contemplating suicide or is otherwise suffering from an emotional or psychological crisis must immediately notify the counseling program in accordance with any rules established by the superintendent or principal. Any counselor or other staff member who knows or has cause to suspect child abuse, neglect, dependency or death as a result of maltreatment must report the information as provided in policy 4240/7312 (Child Abuse - Reports and Investigations) and as required by law. Counseling programs are most effective when voluntarily entered into by a student. School officials and teachers may recommend a counseling program to help a student meet standards of conduct and academic performance established by the board and school district. However, students will not be required to attend individual or small group counseling sessions to address identified significant personal issues unless agreement has been reached with the parent and student in a behavior contract, an intervention plan or, for special education students, in an individualized education plan. (See Student Behavior Policies (4300 series), Student Progression and Placement (policy 3420), Special Education Programs/Rights of Students with Disabilities (policy 3520).) Information obtained in a session with a counselor may be privileged and protected from disclosure as provided by law. A counselor cannot be required to testify concerning privileged information unless, as provided by G.S. 8-53.4, the student waives the privilege or the court compels testimony as necessary to the proper administration of justice. The school counselor privilege does not, however, exempt the counselor from reporting child abuse as required by G.S. 7A- 544. Any notation made by a counselor for his or her own use is a confidential document and is neither a public record nor a part of the student's record. Such confidential documents do not have to be shared with parents or others except as required by law, such as G.S. 7A-544. Any document prepared by a counselor that is shared or intended to be shared with other staff is considered an educational record of the student and is available to the parent or eligible student in accordance with board policy on student records, policy 4700 Student Records.

Generally, in order to carry out the responsibilities of the school system, teachers and other staff members may also be required to perform certain non-instructional and extracurricular duties. Assigned additional duties are considered part of all employees\u2019 responsibilities. However, assignment of additional duties to teachers should be minimized to allow time for teachers to plan, collaborate with colleagues, conference with parents, tutor students and perform any other activities that have a direct impact on student achievement. Beginning teachers also need adequate opportunities to develop their professional skills and need access to experienced teachers who can mentor them. In light of these goals, the principal of each school has the authority to assign extracurricular and non-instructional duties as necessary to conduct the business of the school, within the following guidelines. A. EXTRACURRICULAR DUTIES Initially licensed teachers may not be assigned extracurricular duties unless they request the assignments in writing. 1. Extracurricular Duties Defined Extracurricular duties include those duties performed outside of regular school hours which are not a part of the teacher\u2019s instructional duties. Examples of extracurricular activities for which consent is required include such things as coaching duties, taking tickets at sporting events, or acting as a faculty sponsor for a student club. Extracurricular duties do not include such things as time spent in parent-teacher conferences, or activities related to courses taught by the teacher, such as band concerts that are performed as a part of band class. 2. Exceptions Permitted for Compelling Reasons In cases of compelling need, initially licensed teachers may be required to perform extracurricular duties if the procedures set forth in this paragraph are followed. a. Compelling Need Defined A compelling need arises when the principal of a school is not reasonably able to staff extracurricular activities with qualified personnel without using initially licensed teachers and no initially licensed teachers have volunteered in writing to perform these Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3622/7405 Page 1 of 4 activities. In determining whether a compelling need exists, it will be assumed that teaching assistants and other non-certified employees cannot be assigned to extracurricular duties unless the assignment is approved in advance by the superintendent or designee. Examples of compelling need include circumstances when: (1) an employee who is scheduled to perform an extracurricular duty is unexpectedly unavailable and the position must be filled quickly; (2) the school principal cannot adequately fill extracurricular duty positions without additional reliance on initially licensed teachers; or (3) an extracurricular duty must be supervised by individuals with certain experience, skills or qualifications and initially licensed teachers are the only qualified staff members who possess the required experience, skills or qualifications. b. Process for Granting a Compelling Need Waiver (1) Board Waiver In cases where the need for a waiver is reasonably foreseeable and there is an opportunity to bring the matter before the board of education for approval prior to the extra duty, the superintendent shall bring the matter to the board for a decision on the waiver request. The recommendation for a waiver must be in writing and set forth the circumstances requiring the waiver. The board minutes or other documentation shall reflect the reasons for granting the waiver. (2) Superintendent Waiver If there is not a scheduled board meeting prior to the need to staff the extracurricular activity, the superintendent may waive the requirement upon a finding of compelling need. The superintendent shall make a written record of all such waivers and the circumstances for requesting each waiver. At the next regular board meeting, the superintendent shall report to the board any past waivers made and the reasons therefore. If the waiver is for an ongoing activity, the superintendent must seek and obtain board approval to continue the initially licensed teacher in the extracurricular activity in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (1), Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3622/7405 Page 2 of 4 above. (3) Principal Waiver If there is an exigent need to waive the policy, such as the unexpected illness or absence of an employee, then the school principal is authorized to waive the policy temporarily for up to five days. However, the principal must report the waiver to the superintendent in writing, setting forth the circumstances requiring the waiver. The superintendent must approve all waivers over five days, as provided in paragraph (2), above. The board must approve all continuing waivers at its next regular meeting, as provided in paragraph (1) above. (4) Teacher Access to Records The teacher may request and shall be entitled to receive any documentation regarding any waivers requested or granted under this policy. B. NON-INSTRUCTIONAL DUTIES Principals shall minimize the assignment of non-instructional duties to all teachers, including initially licensed teachers. Specifically, teachers should not be required to use their daily planning periods on an ongoing and regular basis to supervise students. Planning periods generally should be reserved for course planning and meetings with other professional staff regarding the instructional program. 1. Non-instructional Duties Defined Non-instructional duties refer to those duties that are not directly involved with the instructional program or the implementation of the current statewide instructional standards, but that all teachers are expected to do. This includes such things as bus duty, carpool duty and regular and ongoing use of planning periods to monitor hallways and cafeterias. Nothing in this policy should be construed to relieve teachers of the responsibility to provide for the safety and supervision of students during regular school hours, as necessary to maintain order and discipline in the school. 2. Distribution of Non-Instructional Duties Non-instructional duties should be distributed equitably among employees to the extent it is reasonably possible to do so. In assigning non- instructional duties, consideration should be given to the need for initially licensed teachers to have adequate professional development, planning Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3622/7405 Page 3 of 4 time and access to more experienced teachers. Principals shall be responsible for structuring such opportunities in such a way that will be beneficial to their schools. C. EVALUATION The failure of an initially licensed teacher to volunteer to perform extracurricular duties shall not be appropriate grounds to lower the teacher\u2019s evaluation nor just cause for less than proficient evaluation rating of an initially licensed teacher, provided that the teacher has conducted himself/herself in a professional manner when declining to accept extracurricular duties. However, a teacher\u2019s failure to perform an assigned non-instructional or extracurricular duty in a competent and professional manner may be considered as a part of the teacher\u2019s evaluation.

All policies and procedures outlined in the rules and by-laws of these organizations shall be followed by Avery County High School concerning student athletic eligibility and participation. High School athletics are very competitive and it is the responsibility of the head coach of each sport to select a team that can compete at this level of competition. Avery County High School currently offers athletic opportunities to students in 13 interscholastic sports with a total of 27 JV and Varsity teams. These include: Fall: Cross-Country (Co-ed) JV and Varsity Men\u2019s Soccer JV and Varsity Volleyball JV and Varsity Football Women\u2019s Tennis JV and Varsity Cheerleading Winter: Varsity Wrestling (Co-ed) JV and Varsity Women\u2019s Basketball Freshmen, JV, and Varsity Men\u2019s Basketball *Indoor Track (Co-ed) JV and Varsity Cheerleading Spring: JV* and Varsity Baseball JV* and Varsity Softball Men and Women\u2019s Track Field JV and Varsity Women\u2019s Soccer Men\u2019s Tennis Golf (Co-ed) Students in grades 9 \u2013 12 are eligible to participate in Varsity athletics. Interscholastic Junior Varsity athletic teams are composed primarily of students in grades 9 \u2013 10 with participation by students in grade 11 in certain sports with hardship consideration only (WHC rule). Athletic teams vary in the number of participants allowed on the team. While some teams allow all students who \u201ctry-out\u201d for the team to \u201cmake\u201d the team, others must limit participants by the nature of the sport and opportunity for playing time. Teams that keep all student athletes who meet the eligibility requirements include football, soccer, wrestling, track and field, and cross- country. On these teams, try-outs are for positions and the starting line-up. Most Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3624/7406 Page 1 of 3 athletes are evaluated weekly to determine \u201cstarters\u201d. Each team varies in the form of the weekly evaluation. However, student athletes are informed of the criterion that determines starting positions. Teams that hold try-outs for a limited number of positions include volleyball, basketball, golf, baseball, softball, tennis, and cheerleading. Students are informed of the criteria for team selection prior to the try-out period. The length of the try-out period varies by sport and is determined by the head coach. For teams that require try-outs, all student athletes must try-out each year for a position on the team. No student athlete is guaranteed a position on the team based on participation in a prior year at either the Varsity or JV level. The head coach makes the final determination as to which student athletes \u201cmake\u201d the team at both Varsity and JV level. Any student who does not make the Varsity team will be cut, but students who have been on Varsity teams will be considered for the JV team if the student and parent/guardian have signed a form indicating that the student wishes to be considered during tryouts for both the varsity and JV team. The head coach, at his or her discretion, may request the assistance of other individuals (such as trained outside evaluators, assistant coaches, etc.) in making the final cut. However, the final decision rests with the head coach. High school athletics are very competitive. A position on a high school athletic team does not guarantee that a student athlete will participate in every athletic competition or be guaranteed a certain amount of playing time during a sports season. The team rules, practice time requirements, and behavior, however, are the same for all athletes. Cheerleading is an activity that comes under the jurisdiction of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association in two areas \u2013 eligibility and safety guidelines. Cheerleaders, both Junior varsity and varsity, must have their eligibility certified in the same manner as other interscholastic athletes. In addition the NCHSAA Board of Directors has approved a set of safety guidelines from the National Federation of State High School Associations. It is strongly recommended that, before a cheerleading squad uses these safety guidelines, the coach or advisor for the cheerleaders consider their application with the training, experience and athletic ability of the student under supervision. Cheerleaders serve as a support group for the different athletic teams within their schools. Positive crowd and student body involvement, directed by the cheerleading squad in support of the school team, should be the major goal and is a very important component of an athletic program. The squad is not intended to develop its skills and talents solely for entertainment or competition purposes. Cheerleaders should always strive to improve student morale, boost team spirit, and help a school achieve the most worthwhile objectives in its interscholastic program. These activities can provide the student with educational experiences that contribute greatly toward the development of good citizenship.

Any parent or legal guardian who is unclear whether age requirements are met is encouraged to contact the superintendent's office or the elementary school that the child is likely to attend. A. ENTITLEMENT TO INITIAL ENTRY A child who is presented for enrollment at any time during the first 120 days of a school year will be considered eligible for initial entry in any of the following circumstances: 1. the child reaches or reached the age of 5 on or before August 31 of that school year; 2. the child resided in another state and was attending school during that school year in accordance with that state's laws or rules prior to moving to North Carolina. (The child does not need to reach the age of 5 on or before August 31 in this circumstance.) 3. The child did not reach the age of five on or before August 31 of that school year, but would be eligible to attend school during that school year in another state in accordance with the laws or rules of that state, and if all of the following apply: (a) The child\u2019s parent is a legal resident of North Carolina who is an active member of the uniformed services assigned to a permanent duty station in another state; (b) The child\u2019s parent is the sole legal custodian of the child (c) The child\u2019s parent is deployed for duty away from the permanent duty station; and (d) The child resides with an adult who is a domiciliary of a local school administrative unit in North Carolina as a result of the parent\u2019s deployment away from the permanent duty station. B. DISCRETIONARY ENROLLMENTS The board may allow a child to be enrolled in the following circumstances: 1. the child is presented for enrollment after the first 120 days of a school year and meets one of the circumstances specified above for entitlement to initial entry; or 2. the child reached the age of 4 on or before April 16; and the child is presented for enrollment no later than the end of the first month of the school year; and the principal of the school finds, based on information submitted by the child's parent or guardian, that the child is gifted and that the child has the maturity to justify admission to school. In making such a determination, the principal will follow guidelines established by the State Board of Education. This local board regards Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4100 Page 1 of 2 admission of a four-year-old to be an extraordinary measure and not to be used merely because the child is developmentally advanced. C. GRADE LEVEL OF INITIAL ENTRY The initial point of entry will be the kindergarten level. After initial entry, a principal may move the child to the first grade if the principal determines that by reason of maturity, the child can be served more appropriately in the first grade. D. EVIDENCE OF AGE The principal may require the parent or guardian of any child presented for admission for the first time to furnish a certified copy of the child's birth certificate or other competent and verifiable evidence of the child's date of birth. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to: (1) a certified copy of any medical record of the child\u2019s birth issued by the treating physician or the hospital in which the child was born; or (2) a certified copy of a birth certificate issued by a church, mosque, temple or other religious institution that maintains birth records of its members. A birth certificate or other satisfactory proof of age issued by a foreign country or institution will be accepted and treated in the same manner as comparable documents issued in the United States. School officials shall use such documents only for the purpose of establishing the age of the child and not to inquire about the citizenship or immigration status of the child, parent or guardian. For a student who is in foster care or considered homeless, the inability to provide documentation must not prevent immediate enrollment of the student. School officials, or in the case of a homeless student, the homeless liaison, shall immediately contact the last school the student attended to obtain relevant enrollment records or other information needed for enrollment. These officials shall work with the student, the parent or guardian, school personnel, and other agencies as necessary to obtain enrollment information in a timely manner.

The principal or designee shall maintain on file immunization and health assessment records for all students, and these records may be inspected by officials of the county or state health departments in accordance with state and federal law. Each school principal shall file required reports with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Public Instruction. A. Immunization 1. Requirements for Initial Entry Within 30 calendar days of his or her first day of attendance in the school system, each student must show evidence of age-appropriate vaccination in accordance with state law and regulation, including the following vaccines as applicable: a. DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis); b. poliomyelitis (polio); c. measles (rubeola); d. rubella (German measles); e. mumps; f. Haemophilus influenzae, type b (Hib); g. hepatitis B; h. varicella (chickenpox); and i. any other vaccine as may be required by law or regulation. The current required vaccination schedule is available from the N.C. Immunization Branch online at http://www.immunize.nc.gov/. 2. Additional Requirements All students entering seventh grade or who have reached age 12, whichever comes first, are required to receive the following: a. a booster dose of Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine), if they have not previously received it; and b. the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV). 3. Certificate of Immunization a. Evidence of immunizations must be shown in the form of a certificate furnished by a licensed physician or by the health department. A student who received immunizations in a state other than North Carolina must present an official certificate that meets the immunizations requirements of G.S. 130A-154(b). b. Principals are required to refuse admittance to any child whose parent or guardian does not present a medical certification of proper immunizations within the allotted time. If, following approved medical practice, the administration of a vaccine requires more than 30 calendar days to complete, upon certification of this fact by a physician, additional days may be allowed in order to obtain the required immunizations. c. Exceptions to the immunization requirements will be made only for religious reasons or for medical reasons approved by a physician pursuant to state law and regulation. B. Health Assessment/Vision Screening Within 30 calendar days of the first day of school entry, all kindergarten students and, beginning with the 2016-17 school year, all students entering public school for the first time, regardless of grade level, must furnish to the principal a form that meets the requirements of state law indicating that the student has received a health assessment pursuant to G.S. 130A-440. A student who fails to meet this requirement will not be permitted to attend school until the required health assessment form has been presented. Such absences will not be considered suspensions, and the student will be given an opportunity to make up work missed during the absence as described below. The principal or designee shall, at the time of enrollment, notify the parent, guardian, or person standing in loco parentis that the completed health assessment form is needed on or before the child\u2019s first day of attendance. The date the student\u2019s health assessment form is received will be recorded in the student\u2019s official record, and the form will be maintained on file in the school. The assessment must include a medical history and physical examination with screening for vision and hearing and, if appropriate, testing for anemia and tuberculosis. The health assessment must be conducted no more than 12 months prior to the date of school entry. Exception to the health assessment requirement will be made only for religious reasons. Vision screening must comply with the vision screening standards adopted by the Governor\u2019s Commission on Early Childhood Vision Care. Within 180 days of the start of the school year, the parent of the child must present to the principal or his/her designee certification that within the past 12 months, the child has obtained a comprehensive eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist or has obtained a vision screening conducted by a licensed physician, optometrist, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, orthoptist, or a vision screener certified by Prevent Blindness North Carolina. Children who receive and fail to pass the required vision screening must obtain a comprehensive eye exam conducted by a duly licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist. The provider of the exam shall present to the parent a signed transmittal form which the parent must submit to the school. If a member of the school staff has reason to believe that a child enrolled in kindergarten through third grade is having problems with vision, the staff member may recommend to the child\u2019s parent that the child have a comprehensive eye examination. No child will be excluded from attending school for a parent\u2019s failure to obtain a comprehensive eye exam. If a parent fails or refuses to obtain a comprehensive eye exam or to provide the certification of a comprehensive eye exam, the school officials shall send a written reminder to the parent of required eye exams. Upon request, the teacher(s) of a student subject to an absence from school for failure to provide the health assessment form required by this section shall provide to the student all missed assignments, and to the extent practicable, the materials distributed to students in connection with the assignments. The principal or designee shall arrange for the student to take home textbooks and school-furnished digital devices for the duration of the absence and shall permit the student to take any quarterly, semester, or grading period examinations missed during the absence period. C. Homeless Students Notwithstanding the provisions of this policy, admissions for homeless students will not be prohibited or delayed due to the inability to provide documentation of immunizations or health assessments. The homeless liaison will work with the student, parent/guardian, school personnel or other agencies to obtain documentation of immunization and/or the health assessment or to arrange for such immunizations and/or assessments in a timely manner. D. Foster Children Notwithstanding the provisions of this policy, admissions for students in foster care will not be prohibited or delayed due to the student\u2019s inability to provide documentation of immunizations or health assessments. The enrolling school will immediately contact the school last attended by the foster child to obtain any relevant documentation. DE. Children of Military Families The board acknowledges that immunization requirements for newly enrolling military children are governed by the Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children. Children of military families, as defined in policy 4050, Children of Military Families, will have 30 days from the date of enrollment or within such time as reasonably determined by the rules of the Interstate Commission to obtain any required immunization. For a series of immunizations, initial vaccinations must be obtained within 30 days or within such time as is reasonably determined under the Interstate Commission.

Transfer students are students who have been enrolled in or attended a private or public school in this state or another state. In accordance with State law, the student's parent, guardian or custodian must provide a statement made under oath or affirmation before a notary indicating (1) whether at the time of the admission request the student is under suspension or expulsion from attendance at a private or public school in this or any other state or (2) has been convicted of a felony in this or any other state. STUDENTS UNDER SUSPENSION/EXPULSION OR CONVICTED OF A FELONY If at the time of the admission request the student is under suspension or expulsion or has been convicted of a felony, the parent, guardian or custodian must provide to the school district all requested information related to the conduct. The superintendent or his or her designee will review the information and make recommendations to the board as to whether the student should be admitted and whether any reasonable conditions should be imposed. \u2022 Suspension - The board may deny admission to a student who is under a suspension for conduct that could have led to a suspension from a school within the school district. Admission may be denied until the suspension has expired. \u2022 Expulsion - The board may deny admission to a student expelled from school pursuant to G.S. 115C-391 or who has been expelled from a school for behavior that indicated the student's continued presence in school constituted a clear threat to the safety of other students or employees. The student may request reconsideration of the decision in accordance with G.S. 115C-391(d). \u2022 Felony Conviction - The board may deny admission to a student who has been convicted of a felony in this state or any other state. The student may request reconsideration of the decision in accordance with G.S. 115C-391(d). In any of the above-described circumstances where admission may be denied, the board alternatively may place reasonable conditions on the admission of the student. Such conditions include but are not limited to behavior contracts, alternative school placement and limits on free time and extracurricular activities. Drug testing and weapon searches also may be reasonable conditions so long as they meet any constitutional requirements.

Under certain circumstances specified by law, a student who resides in the school district and who otherwise qualifies for admission to its schools also is entitled to be admitted without payment of tuition. In addition, students who are homeless or in foster care may be entitled to continue attending their school of origin without payment of tuition regardless of a change in their domicile or residency status. Children with disabilities are required to meet state domicile requirements to be entitled to admission to school without payment of tuition unless they are \u201cgrandfathered\u201d into the system under subsection C.5, below, or unless they otherwise meet one of the circumstances that entitle them to admission without payment of tuition. (See section C, below.) A. DOMICILE AND RESIDENCE DEFINED Domicile requires the intent to abandon one's prior home and remain in the new location as a permanent home for an indefinite period. In contrast, a residence need not be one's exclusive home and does not require an intention that the residence be the permanent home. B. MEETING DOMICILE REQUIREMENTS Domicile of Students Generally The domicile of a student under 18 years of age is presumed to be the domicile of his or her parents, legal guardian or legal custodian as defined by the General Statutes of North Carolina. Domicile of Emancipated Students If the student is at least 18 years of age, married, or abandoned by his or her parents, or if the court declares a student to be emancipated, the student may establish a domicile independent from that of his or her parents, legal guardian or legal custodian. A student who establishes domicile as a result of being emancipated is a domiciliary of the school system and is entitled to the same rights and privileges of other students domiciled in the school district. Domicile of Students with Divorced or Separated Parents Domicile for the purpose of school attendance will be determined by the following criteria: Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4120 Page 1 of 4 a) In the event that the parents are divorced or separated and physical custody has been given to only one parent, a student's domicile follows that of the parent who has been granted physical custody. b) If physical custody has not been determined or has been granted jointly to both parents, or if the custodial parent wishes the student to attend school in the non- custodial parent's district of residence, then the parents must jointly agree on which residence will be used to determine the child's domicile. The selected residence must be submitted in writing to the school principal/designee and the superintendent. c) The selection may not be changed during the school year unless the parents satisfy the board's policies on transfers and releases. d) In the event that the parents cannot agree on which residence will be used to determine the child's domicile for school assignment purposes, school officials shall assign the student according to the residence of the parent with physical custody of the student at the beginning of the school year will prevail. C. MEETING RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS A student who resides in the district in any of the following circumstances will be admitted without payment of tuition. The student is homeless, as defined in state and federal law and policy 4125, Homeless Students. A student living with a friend or relative is not a homeless student, unless he or she lives there due to conditions that constitute homelessness under state and federal statutes. A homeless student will be assigned in accordance with policy 4125, Homeless Students. The parent, guardian or legal custodian residing in the school district attendance area is a student, employee or faculty member of a college or university, or is a visiting scholar at the National Humanities Center. The student resides in a group home, foster home or other similar facility or institution. The student resides in a pre-adoptive home following placement by a county department of social services or a licensed child-placing agency. The student is considered a child with a disability by the General Statutes and the North Carolina Policies Governing Services for Children with Disabilities; and the child was (a) enrolled in a particular school system on the last day of school for the 2006-2007 school year, or (b) enrolled in and attending a school in a particular local school administrative unit on August 1, 2007 for the 2007-2008 school year, so long as the child lives within and is continuously enrolled in that system. The student resides with an adult, who is a domiciliary of that unit, as a result of any of the following: a. the death, serious illness, or incarceration of a parent or legal guardian; Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4120 Page 2 of 4 b. the abandonment by a parent or legal guardian of the complete control of the student as evidenced by the failure to provide substantial financial support and parental guidance; c. abuse or neglect by the parent or legal guardian; d. the physical or mental condition of the parent or legal guardian is such that he or she cannot provide adequate care and supervision of the student; e. the relinquishment of physical custody and control of the student by the student\u2019s parent or legal guardian upon the recommendation of the department of social services or the Division of Mental Health; f. the loss or uninhabitability of the student's home as the result of a natural disaster; or g. the parent or legal guardian is one of the following: (1) on active military duty, not including periods of active duty for training for less than 30 days, and is deployed out of the local school administrative unit in which the student resides; (2) a member of veteran of the uniformed services who is severely injured and medically discharged or retired (but only for a period of one year after the medical discharge or retirement of the parent or guardian); or (3) a member of the uniformed services who has died while on active duty or as a result of injuries sustained on active duty (but only for a period of one year after the death of the parent or guardian). For purposes of this section, the term \u201cactive duty\u201d does not include periods of active duty for training for less than 30 days. Assignment under this subsection is only available if some evidence of the deployment, medical discharge, retirement, or death is tendered with the affidavits required under G.S. 115C-366. In order to be admitted under this provision, the student can not be currently under a term of suspension or expulsion from a school for conduct that could have led to a suspension or an expulsion from the local school administrative unit, unless the student is identified as eligible for special education and related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400, et seq., and evidence of such eligibility is tendered with the affidavits described below. The adult with whom the student resides and the student's parent, guardian, or legal custodian must complete and sign separate affidavits available through the school principal\u2019s office or the superintendent's office attesting to information required by G.S. 115C-366(a3). If it is found that a person willfully and knowingly provided false information in the affidavit, the maker of the affidavit will be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor and will pay to the local board an amount equal to the cost of educating the student during the period of enrollment. Repayment will not include state funds. D. ATHLETIC ELIGIBILITY Please note that a student who makes a bona fide change in their domicile (residence) is eligible to participate upon enrollment. Under no circumstance can a student have more than one domicile (residence). It is the obligation of each school to know the domicile of each athlete and to require compliance. \u201cResidence\u201d is defined as the equivalent of the term \u201cdomicile\u201d as applied by the courts of North Carolina. Any student enrolled at the Blue Ridge Academy is eligible to participate in athletics at the school he/she was originally assigned if all other eligibility criteria have been met. E. STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE NORTH CAROLINA ADDRESS CONFIDENTIALITY PROGRAM In determining whether a student meets the domicile or residence requirements of this policy, school personnel shall consider the actual address of a participant in the North Carolina Address Confidentiality Program established by G.S. Chapter 15C, but such address shall remain confidential in accordance with law and board policy 4250/5075/7316, North Carolina Address Confidentiality Program. F. APPEAL OF ADMISSION DECISIONS Within 10 working days of receiving all of the information required under this policy, the superintendent or designee shall provide a written decision to the applicant for admission to the school system. The superintendent\u2019s decision regarding admission of the student may be appealed to the board in accordance with subsection E.5 in policy 1740/4010, Student and Parent Grievance Procedure.

In accordance with the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and the North Carolina State Plan for Educating Homeless Children, the board will make reasonable efforts to identify homeless children and youth of school age within the area served by the school system, encourage their enrollment, and eliminate barriers to their receiving an education which may exist in district policies or practices. Based on individual need, homeless students will be provided services available to all students, such as preschool, free or reduced school meals, services for English learners, special education, career and technical education (CTE), academically or intellectually gifted (AIG) services, and before- and after-school care. The provisions of this policy will supersede any and all conflicting provisions in board policies that address the areas discussed in this policy. A. DEFINITION OF HOMELESS STUDENTS Homeless students are children and youth who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. The term \u201chomeless student\u201d will also be deemed to include the term \u201cunaccompanied youth\u201d which includes a youth who is not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian. Homeless children and youth include those students who are as follows: 1. sharing the house of other persons due to loss of housing, economic hardship, or a similar reason; 2. living in motels, hotels, transient trailer parks, or camping grounds due to the lack of alternative adequate accommodations; 3. living in emergency or transitional shelters; 4. abandoned in hospitals; 5. living in a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as regular sleeping accommodations for human beings; 6. living in cars, parks, public spaces, abandoned buildings, substandard housing, bus or train stations or similar settings; or 7. living in a migratory situation that qualifies as homeless because the child lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Avery County Schools Policy Code 4125 Page 1 of 10 B. ENROLLMENT, ASSIGNMENT, AND TRANSPORTATION OF HOMELESS STUDENTS 1. Enrollment a. Eligibility Notwithstanding the enrollment eligibility requirements established by the board elsewhere in policy, school personnel shall immediately enroll homeless students even if they do not have proof of residency, school and immunization records, birth certificates, or other documents; have missed application or enrollment deadlines during a period of homelessness; have outstanding fees; or are not accompanied by an adult. The homeless liaison shall assist the students and parents or guardians in securing appropriate records or otherwise meeting enrollment requirements. b. Records Homeless students transferring into the school district may provide cumulative and other records directly to the school district. The school district will not require that such records be forwarded from another school district before the student may enroll. However, school personnel will immediately request the official records from the previous school. Information regarding a child or youth\u2019s homeless situation must be treated as a student record and protected accordingly. See policy 4700, Student Records. 2. Assignment A homeless student (or the student\u2019s parent or guardian) may request to attend (1) his/her school of origin or (2) any public school that other students living in the same attendance area are eligible to attend. The school of origin is defined as the school the student attended before losing permanent housing or the school in which the student was last enrolled, including a preschool. When a student completes the final grade level served by the school of origin, the school of origin includes the designated receiving school at the next grade level for all feeder schools. Unless not in the student\u2019s best interest, a homeless student who continues attending the school of origin will remain enrolled in the school of origin for the entire time the student is homeless and until the end of any academic year in which the student moves into permanent housing. The superintendent shall designate the Director of Student Assignment or other appropriate personnel to decide, in consultation with the homeless liaison, which school a homeless student will attend. The decision must be based upon consideration of student-centered factors related to the student\u2019s best interests including factors concerning the impact of mobility on achievement, education, health, and safety of homeless students, giving Avery County Schools Policy Code 4125 Page 2 of 10 priority to the request of the student\u2019s parent or guardian or the unaccompanied youth. The superintendent\u2019s designee must presume that keeping the student in the school of origin is in the student\u2019s best interest unless contradicted by the student\u2019s parent or guardian or the unaccompanied youth. If the superintendent\u2019s designee determines that it is not in the student\u2019s best interest to attend the school of origin to the school requested by the parent or guardian or unaccompanied youth he/she must provide a written explanation of the reasons for the determination to the parent or guardian or unaccompanied youth, along with information regarding the right to appeal the placement decision as described in Section D, below. 3. Transportation The board of education will provide homeless students with transportation services comparable to those of other students. In addition, at the parent or guardian\u2019s request (or at the request of the homeless liaison for unaccompanied youth), the board will provide transportation services to/from the school of origin. The superintendent or designee and the homeless liaison shall coordinate homeless students\u2019 transportation needs, based on the child\u2019s best interest. In situations in which a student attends school in this system but his or her temporary housing is in another system (or vice versa), the superintendent or designee shall work with the other system to share the cost and/or responsibility for transportation. If an agreement cannot be reached between the systems, the cost of such transportation will be divided evenly. If a homeless student becomes permanently housed and chooses to remain in his or her school of origin, the board will provide transportation to the student for the remainder of the school year. C. ELIGIBILITY FOR TITLE I SERVICES Homeless students are automatically eligible for Title I services. The homeless liaison and the Title I director shall collaborate to identify the needs of homeless students. D. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS A parent, guardian, or unaccompanied youth who disagrees with a decision of school officials with regard to eligibility, school selection, or enrollment of a student who is homeless (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201ccomplainant\u201d) may appeal the decision to the school system\u2019s homeless liaison in accordance with this section upon registering or attempting to register the child or youth at the school in which enrollment is sought.

However, in order to ensure an expedited appeals process for students who are homeless, the recommendation of the board panel shall be considered the final decision of the board for purposes of appeal to the State Coordinator if a final determination by the full board reasonably cannot be accomplished by the deadline described in the previous paragraph. vi. The written statement of the final decision will include the name and contact of the State Coordinator for homeless education and will describe the appeal rights to the State Coordinator. If the matter under appeal is a school assignment and the appeal was not heard by the full board, the written decision will also note that review of the matter by the full board as required by state law is pending. d. Appeal to the State Coordinator of the Board\u2019s Decision If the complainant is dissatisfied with the decision of the board or board panel, he/she may file an oral or written appeal with the State Coordinator for homeless education within three school days of receiving the board or Avery County Schools Policy Code 4125 Page 7 of 10 panel\u2019s decision.

Transfer of Students During the School Year Change of Residence Students whose legal residence changes from one school assignment area to another within the school system during the same school year may choose to finish out that school year in the same school or attend school in the area to which they have moved. If they elect to remain in the first school in order to complete that year, they will be assigned to the school according to the area in which they live at the beginning of the next school year. Students whose legal residence has changed but who choose to complete the school year at their first school will be responsible for their own transportation to school. Unsafe School Choice Transfer under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Transfers for students who are victims of violent criminal offenses at school or for students attending persistently dangerous schools as defined by State Board of Education policy will be made pursuant to policy 4152, Unsafe School Choice Transfer. The length of the transfer or reassignment will be consistent with legal requirements and policy 4152. Transfer of Homeless Students Students who become homeless between academic years or during an academic year may request to remain at the school of origin for the duration of their homelessness or may request to be enrolled in any public school that other students living on the same attendance area are eligible to attend. Any decision about the transfer or reassignment of a homeless student, as well as the length of the transfer or reassignment, will be consistent with legal requirements and based on the student\u2019s best interest. (See policy 4125, Homeless Students.) 4.Transfer of Students in Foster Care Students who are assigned to foster care between academic years or during an academic year will remain in their school of origin unless remaining in the school of origin is not in the best interest of the student. The best interest of the student will be decided based on all relevant factors, including consideration of the appropriateness of the educational setting and proximity to the school in which the child is enrolled at the time of placement in foster care. The length of the Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4150 Page 2 of 4 transfer or the reassignment of students in foster care will be consistent with legal requirements. Other Transfers The superintendent shall consider student requests for transfer to another school during the school year based upon space availability, the needs of the child, the effect on the school to which transfer is requested, principal recommendations, and other criteria established by the superintendent. Approved applications need only be submitted once for both out-of-district and out-of- county while attending each particular grade span (elementary, middle and high). For example: an approved application for out of district elementary school need not be resubmitted until the student reaches middle school. At that time, the application must be made to attend a middle school that is out of the student\u2019s home district. Any transfer request that is approved based on false or misleading information will be declared void, and the transfer will be rescinded. Assignment to Alternative School Students will be assigned to the alternative school in accordance with policy 3470/4305, Alternative Learning Programs/Schools. Release to Attend Out of Avery County Students living in Avery County and desiring to attend school in another county must receive a release from the Avery County Board of Education before applying to the other school system. The application for release will be effective for the duration of the student's educational career unless the student returns to Avery County Schools and later wishes to be released again. Criteria for Non-Resident Enrollment Students living outside Avery County and desiring to attend school in Avery County must receive a release from their home county before applying to Avery County Schools. No student, neither of whose parents nor legal guardian/custodian (by Court Decree) reside in Avery County, shall be admitted to or enrolled in the Avery County Public Schools System unless they meet the criteria of N.C.G.S. 115C-366(a1) institution for children such as orphanage, (a2) homeless, (b) assignment by school district board, (c) parents in service in General Assembly or N.C.G.S. 115C-366.2 parent teaches at college or university in district. Students who are domiciled in the counties of Burke, Caldwell, Mitchell, and Watauga are covered by reciprocal agreements with said counties due to the extraordinary and particular geographic and topographic barriers limiting the students' access to their domiciliary school and are not subject to the strictures of the listed statutes. Application for Non-Resident Students Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4150 Page 3 of 4 Any student, neither of whose parents nor legal guardian/custodian (by Court Decree) reside in Avery County, must make application and be approved one time to that particular school to become enrolled in the Avery County Public School System. Reciprocal Agreements The Avery County Board of Education recognizes that, due to the particular geographic and topographic barriers existing between Avery County and Caldwell, Mitchell, and Watauga Counties, some students must logically cross county lines to attend the school nearest their homes or communities. Watauga County Schools charges tuition for students from Avery County unless the student is domiciled in the Beech Mountain School/Buckeye Creek Community. The releasing school district and the accepting school district must agree on placement of each student.

The board believes that in most cases, a student should attend the school that serves his or her domicile. However, under certain circumstances or conditions, however, the board provides parents the opportunity to request that their child attend a school outside of his or her attendance area (see policy 4150, School Assignment). Pursuant to federal and State Board of Education requirements, a student who attends a school designated as a persistently dangerous school or a student who becomes the victim of a violent criminal offense at his or her school will be allowed to attend another school that the superintendent has identified as an eligible transfer school. A. DEFINITIONS For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply. 1. Violent Criminal Offenses: the following crimes, which must be reported to the State Board of Education in accordance with State Board of Education Policy HRS-A-000: a. homicide as defined in G.S. 14-17 and 14-18; b. assault resulting in serious bodily injury as defined in G.S. 14-32.4; c. assault involving use of a weapon as defined in G.S. 14-32 through 14- 34.10; d. rape as defined in G.S. 14-27.21, 14-27.22, 14-27.24, and 14-27.25; e. sexual offense as defined in G.S. 14-27.26, 14-27.27, 14-27.29, and 14-27.30; f. sexual assault as defined in G.S. 14-27.33 and 14-33(c)(2); g. kidnapping as defined in G.S. 14-39; h. robbery with a dangerous weapon as defined in G.S. 14-87; and i. taking indecent liberties with a minor as defined in G.S. 14-202.1, 14- 202.2, and 14-202.4. 2. Persistently Dangerous School: a school in which: a. at least two violent criminal offenses were committed with a rate of five or more offenses per 1000 students during each of the two most recent school years, and b. the conditions that contributed to the commission of such offenses are determined by the State Board of education as being likely to continue into another school year. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4152 Page 1 of 4 3. Eligible Transfer School: a school that is not designated as a persistently dangerous school, that offers instruction at the student\u2019s grade level and that the superintendent has identified as eligible for unsafe school choice transfer. B. SCHOOL REVIEW OF VIOLENT CRIMINAL OFFENSES Upon the commission of any violent criminal offense on school property or off school property on a school-sponsored field trip, the principal and the school improvement team shall review the incident to determine whether any conditions or procedures at the school or in the school improvement plan need to be modified as a result of the incident. The principal shall provide a report of the review to the superintendent or designee. C. IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOLS AS PERSISTENTLY DANGEROUS 1. Conditions Contributing to the Commission of Violent Criminal Offenses For any school in which at least two violent criminal offenses and five or more such offenses per 1000 students were committed during each of the two most recent school years, the board will determine whether any changes need to be made in the school- or system-level school safety procedures. The superintendent shall report to the State Board of Education any conditions in the school that may have contributed to the commission of the violent criminal offenses and any plans that the board has to eliminate such conditions. 2. Probationary Schools If the State Board of Education determines that a school should be placed on probation, during the probationary year, the principal and school improvement team shall implement strategies to protect students from violent criminal offenses and to deter future offenses from occurring. Such strategies shall be incorporated into the safe school plan. As necessary, the superintendent may request assistance from the Department of Public Instruction to help identify strategies for implementation. 3. Persistently Dangerous Schools If the State Board of Education determines that a school is a persistently dangerous school, the superintendent shall assign personnel from the central office to review safety procedures at the school. The central office team also shall assist the school with creating and implementing a corrective action plan for the school. The corrective action plan should be based on an analysis of the problems at the school, should include strategies to improve safety at the school, and should identify any system- level policies and procedures that need to be modified. Any strategies identified for the corrective action plan should be incorporated into the school improvement plan. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4152 Page 2 of 4 Pursuant to the unsafe school choice transfer procedures provided below, a student who attends a persistently dangerous school will be allowed to transfer to another school that the superintendent has designated as an eligible transfer school. As deemed appropriate, the board will pursue any appeals process available for review of a school\u2019s designation as probationary or persistently dangerous. D. VICTIM OF VIOLENT CRIMINAL OFFENSE A student shall be considered the victim of a violent criminal offense when the following criteria are met: 1. the principal determines, based upon reasonable evidence, that the student has been the victim of any of the applicable offenses identified in this policy; and 2. the offense occurred while the student was on the grounds of the public school that he or she attends. Pursuant to the unsafe school choice transfer procedures provided below, a student who is a victim of a violent criminal offense shall be allowed to transfer to another school that the superintendent has designated as eligible for transfer. E. UNSAFE SCHOOL CHOICE TRANSFER PROCEDURES The superintendent shall establish procedures to facilitate the transfer of students when a school has been identified as persistently dangerous or when a student has been identified as a victim of a violent criminal offense. Such procedures must include the following elements: 1. notice to parents within 10 days of the determination that their child attends a school that has been identified as persistently dangerous or that their child has been identified as a victim of a violent criminal offense; 2. notice to parents that their student has the opportunity to transfer to another school that has not been identified as persistently dangerous, that serves the student\u2019s instructional level, and that the superintendent has designated as an eligible transfer school; this notice shall be provided no later than 14 days before the start of the school year for students attending persistently dangerous schools and no later than 14 days after determining that a student has become a victim of a violent criminal offense. 3. identification of those schools, including any virtual schools, within the system that are eligible to receive unsafe school choice transfers; 4. identification of other options for unsafe school choice transfers if no Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4152 Page 3 of 4 schools in the school system are eligible; 5. a process for parents to request transfer upon receiving notification of the unsafe school choice transfer option; 6. a process to ensure that transfers are completed by the start of the school year for students attending a school designated as persistently dangerous or as expeditiously as possible but not later than the start of the school year for a student victim, except in extraordinary circumstances; and 7. a report to the State Board of Education and to the local school board of each student transfer made pursuant to this policy. Transfers made because a student\u2019s school was designated as persistently dangerous will remain in effect as long as the school is so identified. Transfers made because a student was a victim of a violent criminal offense will remain in effect at least through the remainder of the school year in which the incident occurred. F. TRANSPORTATION Parents who decide to transfer their child pursuant to this policy are responsible for transportation of their child to the receiving school.

Except in the most extreme circumstances, custody of a student will not be relinquished to any person without the prior approval of the parent or guardian having physical custody. However, if the parents are divorced or separated, the student may be released to either parent, unless the school has been provided with a copy of a court order or agreement that specifies otherwise.

Information on the plan will be made available through the schools. Purchase of this insurance will constitute an agreement between the student and/or parent and the insurance company, not with the school district.

The board also strives to maintain a balance between the need to educate all eligible students, to protect students' and employees' rights, and to control communicable diseases, including HIV and AIDS. Under certain circumstances, students with communicable diseases may pose a threat to the health and safety of students and staff. Decisions regarding the educational status of students with communicable diseases will be made on a case-by-case basis in accordance with this policy. Nothing in this policy is intended to grant or confer any school attendance or education rights beyond those existing by law. This policy shall be shared with school staff annually and with new employees as part of any initial orientation. A. DEFINITION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE A communicable disease is defined as an illness due to an infectious agent, or its toxic products, which is transmitted directly or indirectly to a person from an infected person or animal. B. PRECAUTIONS In order to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, guidelines for necessary health and safety precautions will be distributed by the administration and followed by all school district employees. (See board policy 7260, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens and board policy 7262, Communicable Diseases -- Employees). Employees are also required to follow the school system\u2019s bloodborne pathogens exposure control plan that contains universal precautions and specific work practice controls relating to the handling, disposal, and cleanup of blood and other potentially infectious materials. Students should not be involved in the handling, disposal and cleanup of potentially infectious materials unless the student has been specifically trained in the handling of such materials and is qualified to perform first aid services. Faculty should take reasonable precautions to avoid allowing students to come in contact with these substances. C. CURRICULUM The school district will include health, hygiene and safety education in its curriculum. The curriculum will include age-appropriate information concerning safe health practices that will inhibit and prevent the spread of diseases, including HIV and AIDS. (See board policy 3540, Comprehensive Health Education Program.) D. REPORTING AND NOTICE REQUIREMENTS Avery County Schools Policy Code:4230 Page 1 of 4 In accordance with G.S. 130A-136, school principals will report suspected cases of communicable diseases to the county health department. Confidentiality of such reports is protected by law. School principals are presumed by law to be immune from liability for making such reports in good faith. Without releasing any information that would identify the student, the principal also must report suspected cases of communicable diseases to the superintendent. Additionally, parents or legal guardian shall be notified in a timely manner when their child has potentially been exposed to a communicable disease through the exchange of blood with another individual and it shall be suggested that they contact their private physician or the county health department for consultation. If it has been determined by the local health director that there is significant risk of HIV transmission, that local health director is responsible for determining which school personnel will be informed of the identity of a student with AIDS or HIV infection. The health director is also responsible for determining which school personnel will be informed of the identity of students with other communicable diseases required to be reported. Any employee who is informed or becomes aware of the student's condition shall respect and maintain that student's right of privacy and the confidentiality of his or her records and may not share that information unless specifically permitted to do so by the health director, the student\u2019s parents or legal guardian or by other applicable state or federal laws or regulations. Permission from a parent/guardian to share a student\u2019s HIV status with other school personnel must be in writing. Any documents relating to a student\u2019s HIV or AIDS infection shall be retained in a locked cabinet separate from the student\u2019s other school records and medical records, and shall be released or shared only as necessary to comply with this policy. Employees who are informed of the student's condition shall also be provided with appropriate information concerning necessary precautions and made aware of the strict confidentiality requirements. Release of this confidential information or records, except as permitted by law, constitutes a misdemeanor and may be subject to further discipline. In order to address the needs of the student within the school environment, school employees are required to notify the principal if they are aware or become aware of any student suffering from a communicable disease other than HIV infection. Parents shall be encouraged to notify the principal as well. Students who are immunodeficient, whether due to AIDS or other causes, face increased risk of severe complications from exposure to communicable diseases that appear in the school setting. Although students with HIV infection are not required to notify school staff of their HIV status, students and their parents or guardians are encouraged to inform the principal in the event a student suffers from any such immunodeficiency. Students who are immunodificient because of other communicable diseases, and their parents, are also encouraged to inform the principal. If notified that a student suffers from such immunodeficiency, the principal should request that the notifying party provide information about what types of exposures might put the student at risk and what reasonable practices can be taken in the school setting to minimize risk to the student. Whenever possible, the principal of a school should notify the parents or guardians of an infected or immunodeficient student (or the student him/herself, where appropriate) about the presence of chicken pox, influenza, meningococcus, measles or tuberculosis or other contagious disease occurring in the school that may represent a serious threat to the Avery County Schools Policy Code:4230 Page 2 of 4 student's health. Students who are removed from school as a result of such conditions will be provided instruction in an appropriate alternative educational setting. E. EDUCATION/SCHOOL ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS WITH AIDS/HIV INFECTION Students with AIDS and HIV infection will be permitted to attend school without special restrictions except in accordance with 10A N.C.A.C. 41A.0201-.0204, and this subsection. When the local health director notifies the superintendent that a student with AIDS or HIV infection may pose a significant risk for transmission, the superintendent, in consultation with the local health director, will appoint an interdisciplinary committee in accordance with state health regulations and procedures established by the superintendent. The committee is to consult with the local health director regarding the risk of transmission and advise the superintendent regarding the placement of the student. The committee will include appropriate school system personnel, medical personnel and the student's parent or guardian and may include legal counsel. The parent may request additional participants as necessary to appropriately evaluate the risk. The health director shall be responsible for determining whether to add additional members that may be requested by the parents. The superintendent is also to inform the board of education whenever a committee has been formed and will advise the board of the professional composition of the committee. The interdisciplinary committee will review each case individually in consultation with the local health director to determine (1) the degree to which the student\u2019s conduct or presence in school exposes others to possible transmission or other harm and (2) what risk the school environment may pose to the infected student. If the local health director concludes that a significant risk of transmission exists in the student's current placement, the committee must determine whether an appropriate adjustment can be made to the student's school program to eliminate this risk. If that is not possible, the student shall be provided instruction in an appropriate alternative educational setting which incorporates protective measures required by the local health director. If the administrative or instructional personnel on the committee determine that the student has limited strength, vitality or alertness due to a chronic or acute health problem that adversely affects the student's educational performance, they must refer the student for possible identification and placement as a student with special needs. All deliberations of the interdisciplinary committee will be kept strictly confidential and shared only as allowed by law. Any student records related to the deliberations of the committee will be retained in a locked cabinet separate from the student\u2019s other school records and medical records.

The board encourages eligible individuals to participate in the North Carolina Address Confidentiality Program established pursuant to Chapter 15C of the General Statutes, which protects the address of relocated victims of domestic violence, sexual offense, stalking or human trafficking to prevent a victim\u2019s assailants or potential assailants from finding the victim through public records. The program provides participants the use of a substitute mailing address and denies public access to a participant\u2019s actual address. The Address Confidentiality Program is administered by the State Attorney General. Information and assistance in applying to the program can be obtained by telephone from the Attorney General\u2019s Address Confidentiality Program Office at (919) 716-6785. Program participants receive an authorization card with a substitute mailing address that can be presented whenever an address is required. Mail sent to the substitute address is forwarded cost-free by the program to the participant at his or her residential address. SCHOOL PERSONNEL PARTICIPANTS The name, actual address, and telephone number of any school system personnel participating in the Address Confidentiality Program shall not be open to inspection as a public record, shall not be included as part of any employee directory published by the school system, and shall be redacted from any record released pursuant to G.S. 115C- 320. (See board policies 5070, Public Records, and 7820, Personnel Files.) STUDENT PARTICIPANTS The school system shall use the actual address of a program participant, not the substitute address designated by the Attorney General, for any purpose related to admission or assignment but shall keep the actual address confidential from the public. Student records shall reflect only the substitute address and not the student\u2019s actual address. The student\u2019s telephone number also shall be kept confidential from the public. The parent/guardian of a student participant may request that a student\u2019s name be withheld from any release of directory information by the school, as provided in policy 1310/4002, Parental Involvement. When transferring school records from one school to another, the transferring school may send the files to the participant (parent/guardian) via the substitute address provided by the Address Confidentiality Program to ensure confidentiality of the student\u2019s new location. DISCLOSURE PROHIBITED Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3101 Page 1 of 2 The knowing and intentional disclosure of a program participant\u2019s actual address or telephone number to unauthorized persons is prohibited. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. In addition, violators may be subject to criminal prosecution. Legal References: G.S.

In general, the risk is dependent on a variety of factors including the type of fluid with which contact is made and the manner in which it is made. Body fluids with which one may come in contact usually contain many organisms, some of which may cause disease. Furthermore, individuals who have no symptoms of illness may carry many germs. These individuals may be at various stages of infection: incubating disease, mildly infected without symptoms, or chronic carriers of certain infectious agents including AIDS and hepatitis viruses. In fact, transmission of a communicable disease is more likely to occur from contact with infected body fluids of unrecognized carriers than from contact with fluids from recognized individuals because simple precautions are not always carried out. B. AVOIDING CONTACT WITH BODY FLUIDS When possible, direct skin contact with body fluids should be avoided. Disposable gloves shall be available in the office of the principal. Gloves are required when direct hand contact with body fluids is anticipated (e.g., treating bloody noses, handling clothing soiled with incontinence, cleaning small spills by hand). If any contact is made with body fluids, hands should be washed afterwards. Gloves used for this purpose should be put in a plastic bag or lined trash can, secured, and disposed of daily. Every precaution should be taken to assure that other students also avoid contact with any person's body fluids. C. WHAT TO DO IF DIRECT SKIN CONTACT OCCURS In many instances, unanticipated skin contact with body fluids may occur in situations where gloves may not be immediately available In these instances, hands and other affected skin areas of all exposed persons should be routinely washed with soap and water after direct contact has ceased. Clothing and other nondisposable items (e.g., towels used to wipe up body fluids should be placed in plastic bags). Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4250/6150 Page 1 of 3 D. REMOVAL OF BODY FLUIDS Most schools have standard procedures already in place for removing body fluids (e.g., vomitus). These procedures should be reviewed to determine whether appropriate cleaning and disinfection steps have been included. All schools must stock sanitary absorbent agents specifically intended for cleaning body fluid spills. Disposable gloves shall be worn when using these agents. The dry material is applied to the area, left for a few minutes to absorb fluid, and then vacuumed or swept up. The vacuum bag or sweepings should be disposed of in a plastic bag. Broom and dustpan should be rinsed in disinfectant. No special handling is required for vacuuming equipment. The Bloodborne Pathogens Plan adopted by the Avery County Board of Education shall be conscientiously followed (Policy 7260 Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens). E. HAND WASHING PROCEDURES Proper hand washing requires the use of soap and water and vigorous washing under a stream of running water for approximately 30 seconds. Soap suspends easily removable soil and microorganisms allowing them to be washed off. Running water is necessary to carry away dirt and debris. Rinse under running water. Use paper towels to thoroughly dry hands. F. DISINFECTANTS The contaminated surface should first be cleaned with soap and water. Cleaning with an intermediate level disinfectant should follow this initial step. It is recommended (Communicable Disease Control Branch of North Carolina Division of Health Services) that disinfectants be left on the contaminated surface from 2-10 minutes before removal. Various classes of disinfectants are listed below. Hypochlorite solution (bleach) is preferred for objects that may be put in the mouth. Ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (70%). Phenolic germicidal detergent is a one percent (1%) aqueous solution (e.g., Lysol). Sodium Hypochlorite with available chlorine (1/2 cup household bleach in 1 gallon water, needs to be freshly prepared each time it is used). Three percent (3%) Hydrogen Peroxide Solution (should be fresh solution each time it is used). G. DISINFECTION OF HARD SURFACES AND CARE OF EQUIPMENT After removing the soil, a disinfectant is applied. Mops should be soaked in the disinfectant after use and rinsed thoroughly or washed in a hot water cycle before rinse. Disposable cleaning equipment and water should be placed in a toilet or plastic bag as appropriate. Nondisposable cleaning equipment (dustpans, buckets) should be thoroughly rinsed with the disinfectant. The Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4250/6150 Page 2 of 3 disinfectant solution should be promptly disposed down the drainpipe. Remove gloves and discard in appropriate receptacles. H. DISINFECTION OF RUGS Apply sanitary absorbent agent, let dry, and vacuum. If necessary, mechanically remove with dustpan and broom, then apply rug shampoo (a germicidal detergent) with a brush and revacuum. Rinse dust pan and broom in disinfectant. If necessary, wash brush with soap and water. Dispose of nonreusable cleaning equipment as noted in Section G. I. LAUNDRY INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLOTHING SOILED WITH BODY FLUIDS The most important factor in laundering clothing contaminated in the school setting is elimination of potentially infectious agents by soap and water. Addition of bleach will further reduce the number of potentially infectious agents. Clothing soaked with body fluids should be washed separately from other items. Presoaking may be required for heavily soiled clothing. Otherwise, wash and dry as usual. If the material is not colorfast, add 1/2 cup of nonchlorine bleach, (e.g., Clorox II, Borateem) to the wash cycle.

This will be done by completing the Health Information Form at the beginning of the school year or by contacting the school nurse. A specific emergency plan for each student who is at risk for severe allergic reaction is as follows: If the student is stung or experiences a health condition, he/she must report this to his/ her teacher immediately. Measures will be taken, dependent on what is negotiated between the student's parent/guardian, personal physician, or health care source and the school, as established by the School Nurse on the Emergency Action Plan (EAP). a. A medication may be given to allay reactions or ease the health situation until the student can be transported to the emergency room and/or parents are notified or the condition subsides. This medication is per parent request and meets the Medication to be given at School requirements. ACS policy 6125 b. First Aid measures will be instituted, if an anaphylactic reaction begins or health condition warrants, i.e., use of an Epi-Pen, CPR, AED, and 911 call when indicated. If a student is at risk of allergic reaction to a sting/bite, food, or environmental factor, the parent/guardian is responsible for working with the school nurse to have an EAP in place for the student and to provide the school with the medication needed to meet this plan. The emergency action plan for the individual student must be written and verified with the school nurse. This plan must include the allergy/health condition, signs of an emergency for the specific student, the appropriate emergency steps to take and current telephone numbers where parents/guardians may be reached. It is the parent/guardian responsibility to assure that an emergency plan is developed for their child. No emergency measure will be withheld.

The board is committed to practices that reduce the potential for short-term or long- term effects from such injuries. In support of this commitment, the board directs school employees to comply with the concussion safety requirements for interscholastic athletic competition established by G.S. 115C-12(23) as amended in the Gfeller-Waller Concussion Awareness Act of 2011, and to implement and follow all concussion safety requirements set forth in State Board of Education rules and policies for middle and high schools. The superintendent or designee shall develop a plan consistent with state requirements and shall implement and monitor compliance with this policy. The superintendent is authorized to investigate the use of baseline testing for student-athletes and require that student-athletes undergo such testing prior to their participation in any interscholastic athletic competition. A. DEFINITION OF CONCUSSION A concussion is a traumatic brain injury caused by a direct or indirect impact to the head that results in disruption of normal brain function, which may or may not result in a loss of consciousness. B. SCHOOL HEAD INJURY INFORMATION SHEET Each year, all coaches, school nurses, athletic directors, first responders, volunteers, student-athletes, and parents of student-athletes must be provided with a concussion and head injury information sheet that meets the requirements of the State Board. Before any student, school employee, volunteer or first responder will be allowed to participate in interscholastic athletic activities, including tryouts, practices or competitions, he or she must sign the head injury information sheet and return it to the coach. Parents also must sign the sheet and return it to the coach before their children may participate in any interscholastic athletic activity. The principal of each school shall ensure that a complete and accurate record of the returned signed sheets is maintained in accordance with law and State Board policy. C. REMOVAL FROM AND RETURN TO PLAY Any student-athlete who is exhibiting signs or symptoms consistent with a concussion must be removed from athletic activity immediately. Further, the student-athlete must not be allowed to return to play or practice that day or on any subsequent day until he or she has been evaluated and has received written clearance for participation that complies with the requirements of G.S. 115C-12(23) and any other applicable law or State Board policy.

PURPOSE All decisions related to student behavior are guided by the board\u2019s educational objectives to teach responsibility and respect for cultural and ideological differences and by the board\u2019s commitment to create safe, orderly and inviting schools. Student behavior policies are provided in order to establish expected standards of student behavior; principles to be followed in managing student behavior; consequences for prohibited behavior or drug/alcohol policy violations; and required procedures for addressing misbehavior. B. PRINCIPLES The reasons for managing student behavior are: to create an orderly environment where students can learn; to teach expected standards of behavior; to help students learn to accept the consequences of their behavior; and to provide students with the opportunity to develop self control. The following principles apply in managing student behavior: 1. Student behavior management strategies should compliment other efforts to create a safe, orderly and inviting environment. 2. Responsibility, integrity, civility and other standards of behavior should be integrated into the curriculum. 3. Disruptive behavior in the classroom will not be tolerated. 4. Consequences for unacceptable behavior should help a student learn to comply with rules, to be obedient at a minimum, and when able, to learn to accept responsibility and develop self control. 5. Strategies and consequence s will be age and developmentally appropriate. C. APPLICABILITY Students must follow all board and school behavior policies in all of the following circumstances: 1. while in any school building or on any school premises before, during or after school hours; Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4300 Page 1 of 2 2. while on any bus or other vehicle as part of any school activity; 3. while waiting at any bus stop; 4. during any school function, extracurricular activity or other activity or event; 5. when subject to the authority of school personnel; and 6. at any time or place when the student\u2019s behavior has a direct and immediate effect on maintaining order and discipline in the schools. D. COMMUNICATION OF POLICIES Board policies related to student behavior are codified in the 4300 series. At the beginning of each school year, the principal is responsible for providing each student and his or her parent(s) or guardian with a copy of the student behavior policies and any other school rules and procedures. Students enrolling during the school year and their parent(s) or guardian(s) shall receive a copy of the information upon enrollment. E. ENFORCEMENT The superintendent is responsible for supervising the enforcement of student behavior policies to ensure that school disciplinary policies are uniformly and fairly applied throughout the school system.

The school system does not allow students to be rude, disruptive, abusive or disrespectful to other students, staff or other persons at any time. School employees are required to treat all students, fellow employees and other persons with respect and civility at all times and to set a positive example as a role model in our schools and in the community. In keeping with this policy, we require that all visitors, including parents, who are on our campuses or at school activities for any reason, to act in a respectful and civil manner at all times. Any person, who becomes abusive, profane, loud, disruptive or in any other way is unruly, will be immediately told to leave the property and not return again without prior, expressed permission of administration. Refusal to leave or returning without permission will be grounds for a criminal trespassing charge under state penal code.

Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4325 Page 1 of 2 Middle and High Schools An appropriate consequence for a student who has been found to have sold or otherwise transmitted prohibited substances is presumed to be suspension for the remainder of the school year. Depending upon the circumstances, a student may be permanently expelled (see board policy 4353, Long-Term Suspension, 365 Days Suspension, Expulsion). The superintendent may assign the student to an alternative program if he or she believes that it is in the student\u2019s best interest, the alternative placement is appropriate and placement of the student will not jeopardize the safe and orderly environment of the alternative placement. If an alternative consequence is approved, the superintendent must document the basis for the alternative consequence. Any other violation of this policy may result in long-term suspension up to the remainder of the school year or expulsion. The principal must notify the superintendent of all violations of this policy and recommend appropriate consequences. In making the recommendation to the superintendent, the principal must provide an assessment of whether any available services, such as school counseling services, an alternative school, substance abuse programs or programs provided by other agencies, would assist the student and whether any services should be a part of the consequence. The superintendent or superintendent\u2019s designee must approve any consequence for violations of this policy, including any recommendations for suspension or expulsion. A student re-entering school following treatment for substance abuse should be identified by the school as highly at- risk and provided a transition/support plan developed collaboratively by staff, parent(s) and, when appropriate, the student. The transition/support plan must include periodic monitoring. The superintendent is responsible for ensuring that this policy is fairly applied throughout the school district.

General Policy Statement The Avery County Board of Education strongly believes that drug and alcohol abuse can be detrimental to the physical and emotional health and the academic performance of its students. Furthermore, the Board believes that high school athletes, cheerleaders, and other students participating in extracurricular activities are representatives of the school system and are often role models for other students and, therefore, have great influence on other students. It is from this rationale and out of concern for students\u2019 well-being and safety that a random student drug testing program is being initiated in the Avery County school system. The goal of the random drug-testing program is to help students by deterring and eliminating the use of illegal and/or controlled substances in its schools. II. Administration A. All students in grades 9-12 who desire to participate in any of the following voluntary school activities must agree to participate in the random student drug testing program: 1. Interscholastic athletics; 2. All competitive, extra-curricular activities; 3. All elective clubs (clubs that have no impact on a student\u2019s grade); 4. Students seeking a parking permit on campus; 5. Students who volunteer to enter the program as set forth below. Hereinafter, these activities will be referred to as \"voluntary activities\", as the Board believes participation in these activities is a privilege, not a right. B. To be eligible to participate in the voluntary activities, the student and his/her parents or legal guardians must participate in the random drug-testing program. Participation in the random drug-testing program shall not be required as a condition of attending school, enrolling in any class, or participating in any activity that receives a grade recorded on the student\u2019s transcript. C. Any parent of a student in Avery County Schools may consent to the student voluntarily participating in the random drug testing program, whether or not the student is a participant in any of the voluntary activities listed above. The same procedures will apply, as outlined in this policy, for all students participating in random student drug testing. Furthermore, any parent of a student in Avery County Schools may request when their student is tested as well. Any test performed pursuant to this section may be billed directly to the parents requesting random drug testing of the student. D. The Superintendent or his designee shall develop a plan by which students may volunteer to be placed in a random drug/alcohol testing pool in accordance with this policy. E. The administration shall prepare a Drug Testing Consent Form (RDT Form 1) to be signed by the student and the student\u2019s parent/guardian. The parent/guardian shall be given a copy of the signed Consent Form and this Random Student Drug Testing policy. The original Consent Form shall be kept in the student\u2019s official file. 2 F. Students who desire to participate in the voluntary activities or privileges covered by this program shall sign the Consent Form prior to the beginning of the voluntary activity (e.g. sport season, athletic practice, at the beginning of the school year). The Consent Form will authorize random drug testing throughout the student\u2019s entire school career in Avery County Schools, unless the student and parent revokes consent as set forth below. G. A signed Consent Form may only be revoked in writing. The revocation must be signed by the student and the parent/guardian prior to testing. A student who withdraws will no longer be subject to random drug testing and will not be eligible for participation in the voluntary activities or privileges covered by this policy until after the end of the current school year. After the current year ends, students who desire to participate in any of the voluntary activities must agree to participate in the random student drug testing program by submitting a new consent form. H. A percentage of the students subject to testing at each high school shall be selected for random testing on a periodic basis as deemed appropriate by the Superintendent. I. Refusal to submit to random testing when selected will be treated as a positive test, which invokes the appropriate consequence outlined in this policy. J. Except for the students subject to testing per parent request as set forth in Section (C) above, no student may be randomly tested more than three times in any academic year, so long as the test results are negative. K. The Superintendent may choose not to include certain groups in the testing pool or choose to suspend testing altogether if there are insufficient funds to perform the tests. III. Consequences of testing The student shall not be subject to suspension from school for a positive test, unless the student is in violation of other portions of the Avery County Schools' Student Code of Conduct. Students will not be penalized academically for testing positive for illegal drugs or banned substances under this policy. Many students participate in several voluntary activities, and may participate in multiple activities at one time, such as participating in a sport as well as obtaining a parking privilege. The consequences for a positive test will apply to all activities the student is currently participating and may apply to participation in future voluntary activities as well. A. First Offense: The principal will suspend the student from the interscholastic athletic contests for 30 school days or two (2) athletic contests, whichever is greater, from the date when the written findings are provided to the principal. In addition, the student must successfully complete the following: 1. Student meets with the school counselor within the first full week of suspension or upon return to school. 2. Student undertakes a substance abuse evaluation by a licensed addiction specialist. If the licensed addiction specialist recommends interventions or treatment, student must have begun the process of receiving the interventions or treatments. Avery County Schools is not 3 responsible for the cost of the prescribed interventions or treatments; however, the student is eligible to enroll in the Avery Student Assistance Program at no charge. B. Second Offense: The principal will suspend the student from all athletic activities for a period of 360 school days from the date when the written findings are provided to the principal. C. Third Offense: The principal will suspend the student from all athletic activities for the remainder of his/her high school career in the Avery County Schools. V. Implementation A. Key Implementation Roles 1. Contracted Test Administrator (Vendor) \u2013 The drug testing program will be implemented on behalf of the school district by a Test Administrator, which shall be an independent agency or entity operating under contract with the Board of Education. The contracted Test Administrator shall have experience in implementing a drug testing program. 2. Medical Review Officer (MRO) \u2013 The contracted Test Administrator shall employ or provide by subcontract, a licensed physician certified as a Medical Review Officer. 3. Superintendent's Designee \u2013 The Superintendent shall designate an administrator of the school district to coordinate the district's drug testing program (District Drug Test Coordinator). This administrator will receive all information and results provided by the vendor and the MRO in order to fully coordinate this program. 4. Licensed Substance Abuse Professional (LSAP) \u2013 Licensed substance abuse professionals whose professional credentials are acceptable to the Superintendent and/or designee shall conduct all substance abuse assessment and counseling services. B. Role of School System Employees \u2013 Avery County School personnel shall not assist with the actual testing or physical collection of the samples, shall have no access to the test samples, and shall not select the students who will be randomly tested. These functions will be carried out by the contracted Test Administrator. School system employees will be expected to call students from their regular class schedule and assist with coordinating testing as needed. C. Process to Select Students to be Tested \u2013 Eligible students will be randomly selected for testing by the contracted Test Administrator using the following process: 1. The Superintendent\u2019s designee shall maintain a list of all eligible students who have signed Consent Forms. The list shall be updated prior to each testing date. 2. Each eligible student on the list shall be assigned a number by the Superintendent\u2019s designee. 3. The Superintendent\u2019s designee shall provide the contracted Test Administrator with a list of the students\u2019 numbers. 4. Prior to each testing date, the Superintendent\u2019s designee will notify the contracted Test Administrator as to what percentage of students will be tested. 5. The contracted Test Administrator shall randomly generate a list of student numbers representing students to be tested. The randomly generated student numbers shall be categorized by school, and to the extent practicable, shall consist of the same percentage of students at each school. Students who were absent on a testing date, after their 4 previous selection under this random selection process, shall be added to the next randomly generated list. The list shall be provided to the Superintendent\u2019s designee. 6. The Superintendent\u2019s designee will match the randomly generated student numbers with the students\u2019 names, and will notify each school, which students are to be tested using RDT Form 2A. 7. Documentation of the selection process shall be maintained. D. Absences \u2013 A student who is absent on the day of a test shall be excused from testing, but shall be added to the pool to be tested on the next testing date. However, a student who is present at school on the day of testing and avoids testing by leaving campus (or cutting class) without a valid excuse for that day shall be considered as having refused to be tested. E. Refusal to Test or Tampering with a Test \u2013 A refusal to be tested, or an attempt to alter, substitute, adulterate or otherwise tamper with a test sample, shall result in a declaration of a positive test which invokes the appropriate consequence outlined in this policy. F. Frequency of Tests \u2013 Random drug testing will be conducted as frequently as possible during the academic year. The dates and times of testing will not be publicized in advance. G. Location of Tests \u2013 To the extent possible, the testing will occur at the school which the student attends. H. Number of Students Tested \u2013 The percentage and/or number of eligible students at the high school which will be tested in the course of a year will be determined by the Superintendent or designee. The Superintendent or designee shall determine what number and/or percentage of eligible students are tested on each test date as stated in RDT Form 2A. I. Type of Tests \u2013 Testing will be by urine or saliva specimen. J. Confidentiality \u2013 All test results will be strictly confidential, including the maintenance of the sample throughout the collection and testing process. All reported results will be maintained by the Superintendent\u2019s designee in a locked file cabinet. Disclosure of test results will be limited to those who have a need to know in order to implement this policy. When under this policy a student becomes ineligible to participate in any voluntary activity, the principal shall inform the particular coach that the student is ineligible. K. Falsification of Information \u2013 Students who falsify information on the required forms will be subject to discipline sanctions under Board Policy and the school\u2019s Code of Conduct. L. Parent Notification \u2013 Parents will be notified by school officials of their child\u2019s participation in drug testing after the test is administered through RDT Form 4. VI. Tested Substances The student will be tested for substances recommended by the contracted Test Administrator and as determined by the Superintendent or designee. VII. Substance Abuse Assessment/Counseling Requirement Whenever a student is required to satisfy the substance abuse assessment/counseling requirement of this policy, the student shall: 5 A. Undergo a substance abuse assessment by a licensed substance abuse professional. At parents' request a list of licensed professionals will be provided. This assessment shall be at the expense of the parent/guardian. B. Provide the school principal with written certification by the licensed substance abuse professional that the substance abuse assessment has been completed. C. Undergo counseling/treatment or other intervention, if any, as recommended by the licensed substance abuse professional. The Board of Education will not specify requirements of any such counseling/treatment or intervention, as this will be based on the student\u2019s individual needs. The Board of Education\u2019s interest is that the student receives whatever assistance is appropriate for the particular individual. D. Failure to fully cooperate or comply with substance abuse assessment or any counseling/treatment program recommended by the licensed substance abuse professional shall make the student ineligible for participation in the voluntary activities covered by this policy. VIII. Test Procedures and Safeguards A. Urine Test \u2013 Testing will be by urine specimen. If the student is physically unable to provide a urine sample, a saliva test may be administered. B. Screening Test \u2013 The urine specimen shall be screened using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test or other screening test approved by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). C. Confirming Test \u2013 If the screening test indicates the presence of a controlled substance, the specimen shall be subject to a confirming test by gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). D. Split Sample \u2013 Each student\u2019s urine sample shall be split into two samples. In the event of a confirmed positive test, a student may request that a portion of his/her urine sample be tested by another state or federal approved laboratory at his/her expense. If this test result is negative, the student/parent will be reimbursed. E. Standards for Positive Test \u2013 The contracted Test Administrator will use the standard cutoff scores generally used by CAP or HHS for determining a positive test result. F. Use of Licensed Laboratory \u2013 The contracted Test Administrator must use a laboratory that is appropriately licensed by CAP or HHS. (The laboratory must also be approved by North Carolina state law and accredited to conduct drug testing in this state.) G. Use of Certified MRO \u2013 The contracted Test Administrator must use a physician who is a certified MRO who has met the federal regulation requiring initial MRO certification. Current MRO re-certification must be maintained either through the Medical Review Officer Certification Council (MROCC) or through the American Association of Medical Review Officers (AAMRO). 6 H. Expense - The expense, if any, of the assessment or counseling/treatment program shall be the responsibility of the parent/guardian, not the Avery County Schools. IX. Medical Review Officer A. The Test Administrator shall report any test found \"positive\" for the presence of a tested substance directly to the MRO. B. The MRO shall notify the student and the student\u2019s parent/guardian of the test results and provide an opportunity to present information, such as the documented use of a prescription medication or an over-the-counter drug, which would render an apparent \"positive\" result invalid or \"negative.\" C. Failure or refusal of the student or the student\u2019s parent/guardian to cooperate with the MRO shall constitute a refusal to test, which is considered a positive test. D. The MRO shall inform the student and the student\u2019s parent/guardian of the opportunity for an additional confirming test at the student\u2019s/parent\u2019s expense on the remaining sample of the student\u2019s urine. If the additional confirming test is negative, the student/parent will be reimbursed. E. If the MRO determines that an apparent \"positive\" test result is the result of a lawful use of a prescription or non-prescription drug, the test result shall be considered as \"negative.\" F. If the MRO determines that the test results are valid and positive, the MRO shall inform the student, the student\u2019s parent/guardian of this determination, and the Superintendent's designee. X. Receipt of the Test Results The results of the random drug/alcohol tests will be sent to the Superintendent's designee. The Superintendent or designee will deliver test results to the principal. The parent/ guardian of the student tested will be informed of the test results. In the event of a positive test, a parent conference should be scheduled immediately to review the results of the positive test. At the parent's and/or student's request, the conference may be attended by the adult/school employee supervising the voluntary activity. In the event that the parent/guardian questions the accuracy of the positive test, a student may request that a portion of his/her urine sample be tested by another state or federal approved laboratory at his/her expense. If this test result is negative, the student/parent will be reimbursed. The Superintendent reserves the right to make a final decision on eligibility. A student who tests positive for illegal and/or controlled substances becomes ineligible for the voluntary activities as defined in this policy. Ineligibility will include partici-pation, practice, dressing out, or appearing with the team or group in any way. Any student who tests positive for drugs/alcohol, in addition to other penalties listed in this policy, will provide a negative drug test in order to become eligible. X. Method of Collection of Urine Samples The following procedures shall be used for the collection of urine specimens at the individual schools. 7 A. Notice of Collection \u2013 The principal or designee will notify students to report to a designated area. When the student(s) arrives at the designated area, he/she will be notified of the drug testing procedure and isolated from students not being tested. Student(s) will complete an information sheet outlining current use of prescription and over-the-counter medications and vitamin supplements using Form RDT Form 3. B. Cooperation \u2013 If the student refuses to cooperate with school employees or the contracted Test Administrator\u2019s staff, the student\u2019s refusal to cooperate shall be treated as a \"positive\" test result. C. Time of Collection \u2013 In general, urine specimens will be collected as determined by the contracted Test Administrator in conjunction with a school administrator. D. Collection, Location, Supplies and Equipment \u2013 Each school and the contracted Test Administrator shall select by mutual agreement one or two restrooms to use for collecting urine samples. E. Protection of Student\u2019s Privacy \u2013 The contracted Test Administrator\u2019s staff shall not view a student in the act of providing a specimen, but shall monitor each student in a non- intrusive but controlled manner to detect any attempt to provide a false urine specimen. Immediately upon receipt of a urine specimen it shall be tested to determine its temperature. All specimens outside of normal temperature limits will be considered invalid and the student shall be required to provide another urine sample. F. Chain of Custody \u2013 The contracted Test Administrator shall implement procedures to ensure that each student\u2019s urine sample is appropriately labeled and secured to prevent each sample from being lost, misplaced, or contaminated. At a minimum, the contracted Test Administrator shall: 1. Provide each student with a sanitized kit containing a specimen bottle. The bottle will remain in the student\u2019s possession until a seal is placed on the bottle by the collection staff. The student will sign a form certifying that the bottle contains his/her urine sample and that the specimen has been sealed. The seal may be broken only by the lab testing the specimen. 2. After the specimen has been sealed, the specimen shall be transmitted to the testing laboratory by the contracted Test Administrator. 3. In order to maintain confidentiality, the specimen bottle shall be labeled with the student\u2019s number and not the student\u2019s name. In addition, the results sheet mailed by the laboratory to the contracted Test Administrator or MRO shall report the results by student number and not by name. G. Refusal or Inability to Provide Sample \u2013 The contracted Test Administrator shall implement appropriate procedures for use in the event a student refuses to provide a urine sample or states that he/she is physically unable to provide a urine sample. A refusal to provide a urine sample will be treated as a \"positive\" test result with consequences stated in Section VII of this policy. If a student says that he/she is unable to provide a urine specimen, the student will be given water to provide a urine sample. If the student is still not able to provide the urine sample a saliva test will be administered. If the student states that he/she has a medical problem that prevents the student from providing a urine sample, the student will be given the opportunity to communicate with the MRO, who shall 8 determine whether or not the student has a legitimate medical reason not to be tested by a urine specimen and will, in turn approve a saliva test. XI. Evaluation and Review of Policy The contracted Test Administrator shall provide periodic statistical reports (without identifying student names) to the Superintendent\u2019s designee, indicating the numbers of students tested and the numbers of first, second and third positive test results, by substance and by school. The Superintendent will make an annual report to the Board of Education regarding the impact of this policy. Two years after the policy's adoption, the Board will review the policy's effectiveness and vote whether to maintain, revise or cancel the policy. Legal References: U.S. Const., Amend. IV; N.C. Gen.

Gangs and gang-related activities have proven contrary to that mission and are prohibited within the schools. A gang is any ongoing organization, association, or group of three or more persons, whether formal or informal, having as one of its primary activities the commission of criminal acts and having a common name or common identifying sign, colors, or symbols. The violence and crime that accompany gangs pose a serious threat to the safety of students and employees of the school system. Even absent acts of violence or crime, the existence of gang-related activity within the schools creates an atmosphere of fear and hostility that obstructs student learning and achievement. Thus, the board condemns the existence of gangs and will not tolerate gang-related activity in the school system. A.

NOTICE The superintendent or designee shall regularly consult with law enforcement officials to maintain current examples of gang-related activities, including but not limited to gang names and particularized examples of potential gang indicators including symbols, hand signals, graffiti, clothing, accessories, and behaviors. Each principal shall maintain a list of current examples of gang-related activities to assist students, parents, and teachers in identifying gang symbols and practices. The list shall be available in an easily accessible location in the main office of the school. Parents, students, and school employees may, upon request, access the list, which shall include a warning that wearing or displaying clothing, hand signs, or symbols identified in the list with the intent to convey membership or affiliation in any gang may subject a student to discipline under this policy. In addition, the Code of Student Conduct and all student handbooks (or such other similar materials distributed to parents and students in lieu of a student handbook) shall contain notice that (1) current information on gang-related activities is maintained in the main office at each school; (2) information on gang-related activities is subject to change and the principal should be consulted for updates; and (3) wearing or displaying clothing, hand signs, or symbols identified in the list with the intent to convey membership or affiliation in any gang may subject a student to discipline under this policy. The Code of Student Conduct and student handbook (or such other similar materials) also shall provide the addresses of websites that contain additional information identifying gang signs, symbols, clothing, and other gang indicators. In providing this information for students and parents, the board acknowledges that not all potential gang indicators connote actual membership in a gang. C. CONSEQUENCES Before receiving disciplinary consequences for a violation of subsection A.1 or A.2, above, a student shall receive an individualized warning as to what item or conduct is in violation of this policy and shall be permitted to immediately change or remove any prohibited items. A student may be disciplined only if he or she previously received notice that the specific item or conduct is prohibited. Disciplinary consequences for violations of subsections A.1, A.2 and A.6, above, shall be consistent with Section D of policy 4300, Student Behavior Policies. The superintendent or designee shall list in the Code of Student Conduct the specific range of consequences that may be imposed on a student for violations of these subsections.

Disciplinary consequences for such violations shall be consistent with Section D of policy 4300 and the specific range of consequences listed in the Code of Student Conduct for the other board policy violated. That the violation was gang-related shall be an aggravating factor when determining the appropriate consequences. BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 2 of 3 Policy Code: 4328 In a situation where a student has violated this policy or is otherwise suspected of gang affiliation through other circumstantial evidence, the principal shall conduct an intervention involving the principal and/or assistant principal, the student and the student\u2019s parent. Such intervention also may include the school resource officer and others as appropriate. The purpose of an intervention is to discuss school officials\u2019 observations and concerns and to offer the student and his or her parents information and an opportunity to ask questions or provide other information to the school officials. This policy shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner based on the objective characteristics of the student\u2019s conduct in light of the surrounding circumstances.

When the principal decides to impose a short-term suspension or recommend long-term suspension or expulsion, the principal shall: 1. before or as soon as is reasonably feasible after imposing any suspension, notify the parent of (1) the nature of the misbehavi or: (2) the board policy, school standard or rule that was vi olated: and (3) the consequence that may be or has been imposed; 2. maintain documents and relevant information received about the misbehavi or for revi ew with the parent, taki ng into account the rights of other students or staff that may be involved; 3. make reasonable efforts, if appropriate to meet with the parent before or at the time the student returns to school after any suspension; and 4. make available a copy of this policy and all other applicable board policies, school standards and rules; When a short-term suspension has been imposed, the principal shall inform the parent of the student\u2019s rights under board policy 4351, short-Term Suspension. When a long-term suspension, 365 day suspension or expulsion has been recommended, the principal shall inform the parent of the student\u2019s rights under policy 4353, Long-Term Suspension, 365 Day Suspension, Expulsion, and policy 4361, Appeals of Long-Term or 365 Day Suspensions. If English is the second language of the parent or guardian, the principal shall provide the notice in English as well as in the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s first language when the appropriate foreign language resources are available. All records of parental contact should be maintained in the student\u2019s records and will be retained at least through the end of the school year.

All school officials carrying out a search or seizure are expected to be knowledgeable about the constitutional rights of students and the appropriate procedures for conducting the search or seizure. A search must be justified at its inception and permissible in scope. School officials shall make reasonable, good faith efforts to investigate allegations of misconduct before a student search is conducted. This policy applies to searches conducted on school grounds, in school facilities, or at school-sponsored events. Policy 3225/4312/7320, ACSNet Acceptable Use, not this policy, applies to the search of school system-owned technological resources and the data located on school system- owned electronic equipment. A. S EARCHES B ASED ON I NDIVIDUALIZED R EASONABLE S USPICION A student or the student\u2019s possessions may be searched when a school official has reasonable suspicion that the search will turn up evidence that the particular student has violated or is violating a specific law or school rule. This reasonable suspicion must be based upon specific and articulable facts, which have been acquired through reliable and/or corroborated information from employees, students, law enforcement officers, or other credible sources, or upon visual or other evidence (e.g., the smell of alcohol or marijuana, an alert from a metal detector or drug dog) viewed in light of the totality of the circumstances and the school official\u2019s professional judgment. The scope of the search and the methods used to conduct the search must be reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction. Reasonable suspicion is not required if a student freely, voluntarily and knowingly consents and agrees to the search of his or her person or personal effects. In accordance with the standards described above, the board authorizes the following types of searches based on reasonable suspicion. 1. Searches of Personal Effects School officials may search a student\u2019s desk, locker, and/or personal effects, including but not limited to purses, book bags, and outer clothing. Policy 4212, Student Use of Personal Electronic Devices addresses the circumstances under Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4342 Page 1 of 4 which searches of student cell phones and other electronic devices may be conducted. 2. Searches of Motor Vehicles School officials may search the interior of a student\u2019s motor vehicle. 3. \u201cPat-down\u201d Searches A school official may conduct a frisk or \u201cpat-down\u201d search of a student\u2019s person. The search must be conducted in private by a school official of the same gender with an adult witness present. 4. More Intrusive Personal Searches More intrusive personal searches are discouraged and are to be used only in very limited circumstances. A personal search is more intrusive when it extends beyond a student\u2019s personal effects and outer clothing and potentially exposes intimate body parts and/or undergarments. Such intrusive personal searches will be permissible only if: (1) the school official has reasonable suspicion that a search of a particular student will yield dangerous contraband (e.g., drugs or weapons); and (2) the school official has reasonable suspicion that the student has hidden the contraband in his or her undergarments. This search must be conducted in private by a school official of the same gender, with an adult witness of the same gender present, and only with the prior approval of the superintendent or designee, unless the health or safety of students will be endangered by the delay that might be caused by following these procedures. Body cavity searches and searches that require a student to completely disrobe are strictly prohibited. 5. Metal Detector Searches Except as provided in Section B.2, below, a metal detector may be used to search a student\u2019s person and/or personal effects. The search must be conducted by a school official and will be done in private, when feasible. B. S USPICIONLESS G ENERAL S EARCHES In an effort to maintain a safe, drug-free, and weapon-free learning environment, school officials may conduct certain types of general, suspicionless searches in the schools. All general searches must be conducted in a minimally-intrusive, nondiscriminatory manner (e.g., all students in randomly selected classrooms, every third individual entering a school-sponsored extracurricular activity) and may not be used to single out a particular individual or category of individuals. The searches must be conducted in accordance with standardized procedures established by the superintendent or designee. Absent exigent circumstances (e.g., a report of a weapon on campus), prior to conducting general searches, school administrators must: (1) demonstrate to the superintendent or designee the need for general searches based upon a pattern or expectation of violence, drug activity, or disruption; and (2) provide written notice to students and parents of the school Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4342 Page 2 of 4 policy and/or procedures governing general searches, but not of specific times when or places where searches will be conducted. When conducted in accordance with the standards described above and any corresponding procedures, the board authorizes the following types of general, suspicionless searches. 1. Searches of Desks and Lockers School officials may conduct routine searches of student desks and lockers. Student desks and lockers are school property and remain at all times under the control of the school. However, students are expected to assume full responsibility for the security of their desks and lockers. Student desks and lockers may not be used to store illegal, unauthorized, or contraband materials. A student\u2019s personal effects found within a desk or locker, such as a backpack, gym bag, or purse, may be searched only in accordance with the guidelines for individualized searches of personal effects described in Section A, above. 2. Point-of-Entry Metal Detector Searches Due to the increasing problem of weapons in schools, school officials may use metal detectors to conduct general point-of-entry searches of students and other persons for weapons. 3. Use of Trained Dogs With the prior approval of the superintendent, and in conjunction with local law enforcement, school officials may use trained dogs (canines) to locate illegal materials. All dogs must be accompanied by a certified and authorized trainer who is responsible for the dog\u2019s actions and who is able to verify the dog\u2019s reliability and accuracy in sniffing out illegal material. Trained dogs may sniff lockers, desks, book bags, motor vehicles, and other inanimate objects. Dogs may not be used to sniff students or other persons under any circumstances. No students should be present during a dog search. Before a search occurs in a classroom, students will first be moved to a location outside the classroom. C. S EIZED I TEMS Any illegal contraband seized by school officials must be promptly turned over to the proper law enforcement authorities. D. F AILURE TO C OOPERATE A student\u2019s failure to cooperate with a reasonable search or seizure as provided in this policy will be considered a violation of the expected standard of behavior, and will subject the student to appropriate consequences. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4342 Page 3 of 4 Any person who is not a student who refuses to permit a general metal detector search of his or her person and/or belongings at the point-of-entry to a school-sponsored activity may be denied entry to the activity. E. NOTICE School principals shall take reasonable steps to provide notice of this policy to students and parents at the start of each school year. Legal References: U.S. Const. amend.

As required by law, the superintendent shall maintain the following data on each student suspended for more than 10 days, reassigned for disciplinary reasons, expelled or to whom corporal punishment was administered: race, gender, age, grade level, ethnicity, disability status, type of incident or offense, duration of the suspension, whether alternative education services were provided, and whether the student had multiple suspensions in that academic year. As secretary to the board, the superintendent also shall maintain records from the board\u2019s consideration of 365 day suspensions and expulsions and any readmission reconsiderations of 365-day suspension and expulsions. The superintendent shall ensure that data on disciplinary incidents is reported using the North Carolina Window on Education (NC WISE) system in accordance with State Board of Education policies and procedures. \u0392. DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS Confidential student records concerning conduct that posed a significant safety risk to the student or others in the school community may be disclosed to teachers and school officials, including teachers and school officials in other schools, who have legitimate educational interests in the behavior of the student. C. REMOVAL OF RECORDS 1. End of the Year Removal The following types of discipline records may not be removed from student records, electronic files and databases at the end of the school year: A) notice of any suspension for a period of more than 10 days and the record of the conduct for which the student was suspended; B) notice of any expulsion under G.S. 115C-391 and the record of the conduct for which the student was expelled; and C) any records (including in-school suspension or short-term suspensions) that need to be maintained in order to be able to serve the student appropriately or to protect the safety of others. 2. Expunging Records Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4345 Page 1 of 2 The superintendent or designee shall expunge any records regarding suspensions for a period of more than 10 days or expulsion if the following criteria are met: A) A request that the record be expunged is made to the superintendent or designee by the student\u2019s parent or guardian, or the student if the student is at least 16 years old or is emancipated; B) The student either graduates from high school or is not suspended or expelled again during the two-year period commencing on the date of the student\u2019s return to school after the expulsion or suspension; and C) The superintendent or designee determines that the maintenance of the record is no longer needed to adequately serve the child or to maintain safe and orderly schools. In addition, the superintendent may expunge from a student\u2019s official record any notice of suspension or expulsion provided criteria b and c above are met.

A short-term suspension does not include (1) the removal of a student from class by the classroom teacher, principal or other authorized school personnel for the remainder of the subject period or for less than one-half of the school day,(2) the changing of a student\u2019s location to another room or place on the school premises or (3) a student\u2019s absence under G.S. 130A-440 (for failure to submit a school health assessment form within 30 days of entering school). A student who is placed on a short-term suspension will not be permitted to be on school property or to take part in any school function during the period of suspension without prior approval from the principal. The principal or designee has the authority to determine when a short-term suspension is an appropriate consequence and to impose the suspension, so long as all relevant board policies are followed. In accordance with G.S. 115C-390.6(e) and 115C-45(c)(1), a student is not entitled to appeal the principal\u2019s decision to impose a short-term suspension to either the superintendent or the board unless it is appealable on some other basis. A. Pre-Suspension Rights of the Student Except in the circumstances described below, a student must be provided with an opportunity for an informal hearing with the principal or designee before a short-term suspension is imposed. The principal or designee may hold the hearing immediately after giving the student oral or written notice of the charges against him or her. At the informal hearing, the student has the right to be present, to be informed of the charges and the basis for the accusations against him or her, and to make statements in defense or mitigation of the charges. The principal or designee may impose a short-term suspension without first providing the student with an opportunity for a hearing if the presence of the student (1) creates a direct and immediate threat to the safety of other students or staff or (2) substantially disrupts or interferes with the education of other students or the maintenance of discipline at the school. In such cases, the principal shall give the student notice of the charges and an opportunity for an informal hearing as soon as practicable. B. Students Rights During the Suspension The student under short-term suspension must be provided with the following: 1. the opportunity to take textbooks home for the duration of the suspension; 2. upon request, the right to receive all missed assignments and, to the extent practicable, the material distributed to students in connection with such assignments; and 3. the opportunity to take any quarterly, semester or grading period examinations missed during the suspension period. C. Notice to Parent of Guardian When imposing a short-term suspension, the principal or designee shall provide the student\u2019s parent or guardian with notice that includes the reason for the suspension and a description of the student conduct upon which the suspension is based. The principal or designee must give this notice by the end of the workday during which the suspension is imposed when reasonably possible, but in no event more than two days after the suspension is imposed. If English is the second language of the parent, the notice must be provided in English and in the parent\u2019s primary language, when the appropriate foreign language resources are readily available. Both versions must be in plain language and easily understandable. The initial notice may be by telephone, but it must be followed by timely written notice. The written notice must include all of the information listed above and may be sent by fax, e-mail or any other method Avery County Schools Policy 4351 reasonably designed to give actual notice. School officials also shall maintain a copy of the written notice in the student\u2019s educational record.

DEFINITIONS 1. Superintendent For purposes of this policy, superintendent includes the superintendent and the superintendent\u2019s designee. 2. Principal For purposes of this policy, principal includes the principal and the principal\u2019s designee. 3. Long-Term Suspension A long-term suspension is the disciplinary exclusion of a student from attending his or her assigned school for more than 10 school days. Disciplinary reassignment of a student to a full-time educational program that meets the academic requirements of the standard course of study established by the State Board of Education and that provides the students with the opportunity to make timely progress toward graduation and grade promotion is not a long- term suspension requiring the due process procedures set out in this policy, nor is an absence under G.S. 130A-440 (for failure to submit a school assessment form within 30 days of entering school). Upon the recommendation of the principal, the superintendent may impose a long-term suspension on a student who willfully engages in a serious violation of the code of Student Conduct and the violation either (1) threatens the safety of students, staff or school visitors, or (2) threatens to substantially disrupt the educational environment. The principal may recommend long-term suspension for a minor violation if aggravating circumstances justify treating the student\u2019s behavior as a serious violation. If the offense leading to the long-term suspension occurred before the final quarter of the school year, the exclusion must be no longer than the remainder of the school year in which the offense was committed. If the offense leading to the long-term suspension occurred during the final quarter of the school year, the exclusion may include a period up to the remainder of the school year in which the offense was committed and the first semester of the following school year. 4. 365-Day Suspension A 365 day suspension is the disciplinary exclusion of a student from attending his or her assigned school for 365 days. The superintendent may impose a 365-day suspension only for certain firearm and destructive violations, as defined in board policy 4333, Weapons, Bomb Threats, Terrorist Threats and Clear Threats to Safety. 5. Expulsion An expulsion is the indefinite exclusion of a student from school enrollment for disciplinary purposes. Upon recommendation of the superintendent, the board may expel a student who is 14 years of age or older for certain types of misbehavior as provided in policy 4325, Drugs and Alcohol, policy 4330, Theft, Trespass and Damage to Property, policy 4331, Assaults, Threats and Harassment, and policy 4333, Weapons, Bomb Threats, Terrorist Threats and Clear Threats to Safety, if the student\u2019s continued presence in school constitutes a clear threat to the safety of other students or employees. Additionally, a student who is subject to policy 4260, Student Sex Offenders, may be expelled if the student\u2019s continued presence in school constitutes a clear threat to the safety of other students or employees. During the expulsion, the student is not entitled to be present on educational property and is not considered a student of the school system. B. DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE CONSEQUENCE Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4353 1. Principal\u2019s Recommendation The principal may impose a short-term suspension or any other consequence that is consistent with board policies 4351 (Short-Term Suspension) and 4302 (School Plan for Management of Student Behavior), and the Student Code of Conduct. If the principal determines that a suspension of more than 10 days (either long-term or 365-day) or an expulsion is an appropriate consequence, the principal shall propose the disciplinary penalty based upon a review of the student\u2019s culpability and dangerousness and the harm caused by the student, plus any other mitigating or aggravating factors the principal finds relevant. a. Culpability of Student \u2013 In assessing the culpability of the student for his or her behavior, the principal my consider criteria such as: 1) the student\u2019s age; 2) the student\u2019s ability to form the intent to cause harm that occurred or could have occurred; 3) evidence of the student\u2019s intent when engaging in the conduct. b. Dangerousness of the Student \u2013 In assessing the dangerousness of the student the principal may consider criteria such as: 1) the student\u2019s discipline record or criminal record related to anti-social behavior or drugs and alcohol; 2) whether weapons were involved in the incident and whether the student had the ability to inflict serious injury or death with the weapon(s); 3) evidence of the student's ability to cause the harm that was intended or that occurred; and 4) whether the student is subject to policy 4260, Student Sex Offenders. c. Harm Caused by the Student \u2013 In assessing the severity of harm caused by the student, the principal may consider criteria such as whether any of the following occurred: 1) someone was physically injured or killed; 2) someone was directly threatened or property was extorted through the use of a weapon; 3) someone was directly harmed, either emotionally or psychologically; 4) educational property or personal property of others was damaged; or 5) students, school employees or parents were aware of the presence of a weapon or of dangerous behavior on the part of the perpetrator. After considering the above factors, the principal shall make a recommendation to the superintendent, stating the nature of the offense, the substance of the evidence involved, and the length of suspension recommended. The principal also must consider and make a recommendation as to whether any alternative education services, counseling or other programs should be part of the consequence for violating board policy, the Code of Student Conduct, school standards and/or school rules. If the principal recommends a 365-day suspension, he or she must identify the type of firearm or destructive device involved and the evidence substantiating that the student brought it to school grounds or to a school activity or possessed it on school grounds or at a school activity. If expulsion is recommended, the principal shall identify the basis for determining that there is clear and convincing evidence that the student\u2019s continued presence in school constitutes a clear threat to the safety of other students or employees. Notice to the Student\u2019s Parent Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4353 The principal must provide the student's parent or guardian written notice of the recommendation for long-term suspension, 365-day suspension or expulsion by the end of the workday during which the long-term suspension or expulsion is recommended when reasonably possible or as soon thereafter as practicable. The notice must be written in plain English and, when appropriate language resources are readily available, also in the parent\u2019s native language. The notice must contain the following ten elements: a. the notice type, i.e., notice of long-term suspension, 365-day suspension or expulsion, b. a description of the incident and the student\u2019s conduct that led to the recommendation; c. the specific provisions of the student conduct policy or rule that the student allegedly violated; d. the specific process by which the parent or guardian may request a hearing to contest the decision and the deadline for making the request; e. the process by which the hearing will be held, including all due process rights to be accorded the student during the hearing; f. notice of the right to retain an attorney to represent the student in the hearing process; g. notice that an advocate, instead of an attorney, may accompany the student to assist in the presentation of the appeal; h. notice of the right to review and obtain copies of the student's educational records prior to the hearing; i. a reference to policy 4345 Student Discipline Records, regarding the expungement of disciplinary records; and j. the identity and phone number of a school employee whom the parent may call to obtain assistance in receiving a Spanish translation of the English language information included in the document. (This information must be provided on the notice in both English and Spanish). Superintendent\u2019s Decision The student or his or her parent(s) or guardian(s) may request a hearing before the superintendent or designee within three days of receipt of notice from the principal regarding the recommendation for long-term suspension, 365-day suspension, or expulsion. Any hearing held will follow the hearing procedures outlined in Section A of policy 4370, Student Discipline Hearing Procedures. A decision will be rendered before the long-term suspension is imposed. If the student or parent/guardian makes a timely request for a hearing, the superintendent shall confirm that the charges against the student, if substantiated, could warrant the recommended disciplinary action and shall give the student and parent reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing. If neither the student nor the parent/guardian appears for a scheduled hearing after being given reasonable notice of the time and place of the hearing, the student and parent are deemed to have waived the right to a hearing. If the student and parent/guardian fail to make a timely request for a hearing or if they waive the right to a hearing by failing to appear for a duly scheduled hearing, the superintendent shall review the circumstances of the recommended long-term suspension. Following this review, the superintendent (1) may impose the long-term or 365-day suspension if it is consistent with board policies and appropriate under the circumstances, (2) may impose another appropriate penalty authorized by board policy or 3) may decline to impose any penalty. If the student or parent/guardian requests a postponement of the hearing, or if the request for the hearing is untimely, the hearing will be rescheduled, but the student does not have the right to return to school pending the hearing. Based upon substantial evidence presented at the hearing, the superintendent shall decide whether to uphold, modify or reject the principal\u2019s recommendation. The superintendent or designee shall immediately inform the principal of his or her decision with regard to the recommended disciplinary penalty of a long-term or 365-day suspension and, when Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4353 applicable, of any modifications to the penalty recommended by the principal. The superintendent shall send notice of the decision via certified mail to the student\u2019s parent or guardian. The notice must include: (1) the basis of the decision, with reference to any policies or rules that the student violated; (2) notice of what information will be included in the student\u2019s official record pursuant to G.S. 115C-402; (3) notice of the student\u2019s right to appeal the decision and the procedures for such appeal; (4) if the decision is to suspend the student for 365 days, notice of the student\u2019s right to petition the board for readmission under G.S. 115C-390.12; (5) if applicable, notice that the superintendent is recommending to the board that the student be expelled and any required notifications related to the expulsion if the student did not already receive such notice from the principal or designee; and (6) if the student is to be suspended, notice of the superintendent\u2019s decision on whether to offer alternative education services to the student during the period of suspension, and, as applicable, a description of the services to be offered or the reason justifying the superintendent\u2019s or designee\u2019s decision to deny such services. Following issuance of the decision, the superintendent shall implement the decision by authorizing the student\u2019s return to school upon the completion of any short-term suspension or by imposing the suspension reflected in the decision. The superintendent shall offer alternative education services to any student who receives a long- term of 365-day suspension unless the superintendent provides a significant or important reason for declining to offer such services. Alternative education services are part-time or full-time programs that provide direct or computer-based instruction to allow the student to progress in one or more core academic courses. Such services may include programs described in policy 3470/4305 Alternative Learning Programs/Schools. The student may appeal to the board the superintendent\u2019s decision not to provide alternative education services, as permitted by G.S. 115C-4(c)(1). Any appeal to the board must be made in writing within five days of receiving the superintendent\u2019s decision. The superintendent shall inform the board chairperson of the request for an appeal and arrange in a timely manner a hearing before the board. In advance of the hearing, the superintendent shall provide to the student and parent and to the board, a written explanation for the denial of services along with any documents or other information supporting the decision. The hearing will be conducted pursuant to policy 2500 Hearings Before the Board. The board will provide to the student and parent and to the superintendent written notice of its decision within 30 days of receiving the appeal. If the superintendent determines that expulsion is appropriate, the superintendent shall submit to the board a recommendation and the basis for the recommendation along with any proposal for the alternative education services. Hearings Before the Board a. Long-Term or 365-day suspensions: A student or his or her parent or guardian may appeal an imposed long-term or 365-day suspension. The student or his or her parent or guardian must appeal to the board in writing within three days of receiving the superintendent's decision. The superintendent shall inform the board chairperson of the request for an appeal and arrange in a timely manner a hearing before the board. The suspension need not be postponed pending the outcome of the appeal. The hearing will be conducted pursuant to Section B of policy 4370, Student Discipline Hearing Procedures. The board will provide to the student and parent/guardian and to the superintendent written notice of its decision not more than 30 calendar days after receiving the appeal. b. For Expulsions: The student or his or her parent or guardian may request a hearing within five days of receiving notice that the superintendent is recommending that the student be expelled. The hearing will be scheduled with the board within five days of the superintendent\u2019s receipt of the hearing request. The superintendent or designee shall notify the parent or guardian of the date, time and place of Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4353 the hearing. Any appeal of a long-term suspension or 365-day suspension will be addressed in the same hearing. The hearing will be conducted pursuant to Section B of policy 4370, Student Discipline Hearing Procedures. If a hearing is not requested by the parent, guardian or student, the superintendent will then submit written evidence to support the recommendation to the board. The board may elect to request a hearing or request additional records and documents. When the board decides to expel a student, the board will document the basis for the board\u2019s determination that there is clear and convincing evidence that the student\u2019s behavior indicates that the student\u2019s continued presence in school constitutes a clear threat to the safety of other students or employees. The board also will consider and make a written determination of whether alternative educational services are to be provided for any expelled student. Regardless of whether alternative educational services are provided by the school system, the board expects the school district to work with other agencies to help the student and parent/guardian identify other types of services that may be of assistance to the student. The superintendent or designee shall send via certified mail to the student\u2019s parent or guardian a copy of the decision, notification about what information shall be included in the student\u2019s official record, and the procedure for expungement of this information under G.S. 115C-402, and notice of the right to petition for readmission pursuant to G.S. 115C-390.12. c. Educational Services for Students with Disabilities During Long-Term Suspension, 365-Day Suspension or Expulsion Students with disabilities recognized by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act shall receive alternative educational services during periods of suspension or expulsion to the extent required by Policies Governing Services for Children with Disabilities and state and federal law. d. Reducing Suspension and Expulsion Rates Though the board believes that suspension or expulsion may be an appropriate and necessary consequence in certain situations, the board also recognizes that excessive use of suspension and expulsion may have a negative impact on academic achievement and graduation rates. Thus, the board encourages school administrators to find ways to reduce suspension and expulsion rates in schools. Legal References: U.S. Const. amend.

The purpose of the hearing will be to determine the facts relevant to the alleged behavior and the credibility of witnesses, based on the evidence presented at the hearing The hearing will be informal and conducted in private. Prior to the hearing, the student and his or her parents and representative will have an opportunity to review any audio or video recordings of the incident and, consistent with federal and state student records laws and regulations, the information that may be presented as evidence against the student, including statements made by witnesses whose names are withheld in accordance with number 5 below. The hearing must be attended by the superintendent, the principal and assistant administrators and any persons the superintendent necessary. The student has the right to be present at the hearing, to be accompanied by his or her parents and to be represented by an attorney or non-attorney advocate. Witnesses should be present only when providing information. The school representatives have the burden of proving the misbehavior, the violation of board policy or school standards or rules and the appropriateness of the recommended consequence for the violation. The school representatives will present first the witnesses and documentary evidence against the student. School officials may withhold witness names or other identifying information if identification of a witness could threaten the witness's safety. After the school representatives have presented their evidence, the student or his or her representative may present evidence relating to the alleged disciplinary infraction, the student's intent at the time of the incident, any mitigating or aggravating factors involved, the disciplinary and academic history of the student and the potential benefits to the student of alternatives to suspension.

Every parent, guardian, or other person in North Carolina having charge or control of a child under age seven who is enrolled in a public school in grades Kindergarten through two shall also cause such child to attend school continuously for a period equal to the time which the public school to which the child is assigned shall be in session unless the child has withdrawn from school. No person shall encourage, entice, or counsel any student to be unlawfully absent from school. The term \"school\" is defined to embrace all public schools and such non-public schools which have teachers and curricula that are approved by the State Board of Education. Attendance Regular attendance is a significant factor in educational achievement and should be encouraged in an effort to facilitate each student's optimum development. The public schools, like business and industry, must have rules and regulations concerning attendance. The purpose of this policy is to promote attendance, to help students form habits of acceptable attendance and punctuality, and to place the responsibility for school attendance on the student and his/her parents. The school supports attendance through maintaining attendance records and communicating with parents concerning any issues that may arise. The school's staff shall endeavor to cooperate fully with parents and students in matters concerning absences, tardies, and early departures. Power School The Power School database is considered the legal document for calculating daily school attendance and will be used in the prosecution for non-attendance and in calculations for perfect attendance awards. In order for a student to be counted present for the school day, the student must be present at least one-half of the school\u2019s instructional day. The determination of excused or unexcused absence will be made by the homeroom (advisory) teacher or attendance clerk through a documented excuse from the parents, legal guardian, or doctor. If, on the day of the student's return to class, a teacher or clerk receives no notification from the parent regarding the reason for the absence, the teacher or clerk shall assume the absence was unexcused and code it as such in the Power School database. Counted absences shall include, but are not limited to, the following reasons: sickness, routine medical and dental visits, family trips, college visits, funerals, truancy, religious holidays, out-of-school suspension, and any personal reason. In the case of excused absences, short-term out-of-school suspensions, and absences under G.S. 130A- Page 1 of 5 Avery County Schools Policy Policy Code 4400 440 (for failure to submit a school health assessment form within 30 days of entering school) the student will be permitted to make up his or her work. (See also policies 4110, Immunization and Health Requirements for School Admission, and 4351, Short-Term Suspension.) The teacher will determine when work is to be made up. The student is responsible for finding out what assignments are due and completing them within the specified time period. A minimum of two days each academic year can be excused for the observance of an event required or suggested by the religion of the student or student's parent(s) with written prior approval from the principal. The student shall have the opportunity to make up any tests or other work missed due to the excused absence for a religious observance. On days of inclement weather when a school bus cannot run a child\u2019s road and the child is unable to attend school for that day, the absence will be considered excused and the homeroom teacher will code it as such. As soon as a parent anticipates extended absences of two or more weeks because of a severe, prolonged, or chronic illness, the parent shall notify the principal. The principal shall make arrangements for home-bound, hospital-bound, or other appropriate instruction only upon the advice of the attending physician. (See Policy 3133 Homebound Instruction.). Parents should address all questions to the principal. A student will be granted additional excused absences whose parent or legal guardian (a) is an active duty member of the uniformed services as defined by policy 4050, Children of Military Families, and (b) has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or has immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting. The superintendent or designee will have discretion in this matter. A student not in attendance is counted absent. GRADES K-8 The student's report card is considered notification of absences and tardies. North Carolina General Statute 115C-378 requires that letters of notification that their student has accumulated three (3), six (6) and ten (10) unexcused absences per school year. (See sample letter, Appendix 4400A.) The principal may refer a student and their parent(s)/guardian(s) to mediation at a Community Mediation Center to attempt to resolve attendance issues in cases in which: \u25aa A student has 3 or more unexcused absences; \u25aa A student has noticeable or suspicious absences that seem to follow a pattern, (i.e. every Friday); \u25aa A student has more than 10 tardies or early releases; \u25aa A student has an excessive number of excused absences. Page 2 of 5 Avery County Schools Policy Policy Code 4400 GRADES 9-12 The Avery County Board of Education follows state law concerning daily attendance. This policy addresses per-period class attendance in grades 9-12 only. It is designed to encourage regular attendance and relates to the requirements for credit. Attendance is an essential element in the learning process. The primary responsibility of school attendance rests with students and parents. Because high school students daily receive 90 minutes of instruction in each class, the equivalent of two instructional days on a year-long schedule, good attendance is crucial. Based on these considerations, students missing more than ten (10) days in a class per semester will receive an \u201cFF\u201d (failure due to absences) on their report card. In an effort to provide students with absences in excess of the ten (10) allotted per semester an opportunity to prevent loss of credit, students will be provided with the opportunity to attend summer school. Students must make up time for time, meaning that 90 minutes missed requires 90 minutes to be made up. It should also be noted that students must attend at least 75% of the class period in order to be counted as present. Students who are not in attendance for at least 75% of the class period will be counted absent. I. Make-up Time for Excessive Absences in High School Classes A student who is absent from a course/class during more than ten (10) classes within a semester shall be required to make up equivalent time for each class period missed in excess of ten (10) hereinafter, \"excessive absences\". In determining \"excessive absences\" no absence from a class due to the student's participation in an authorized school activity or because of in-school suspension shall be considered. Extenuating circumstances, i.e. an extended illness, should be brought to the attention of the administration, with such circumstances being dealt with at the discretion of the administration. The parent should notify the principal as soon as he/she anticipates a student's extended absence because of a severe, prolonged, or chronic illness under a physician's care. A student who has incurred excessive absences in a course and who either does not perform the make-up time or does not comply with any alternative program that may have been provided by the principal shall receive a grade no higher than 59/FF in that course for the grading period (i.e. nine weeks). [If a student earns a grade lower than 59 for the nine weeks in a course the student will receive the grade earned.] Students who accrue greater than 10 absences per class per semester will be required to attend summer school in order to receive credit, provided course performance was such to warrant summer school as an effective Page 3 of 5 Avery County Schools Policy Policy Code 4400 means of considering mastery of the subject. Records shall be maintained of the amount of make-up time required, or principal's alternative program, and the work to be completed. Parents shall be notified in writing of the requirements for a student to successfully make up excessive absences. Procedures for Make-Up for Absences in High School Courses: 1. Absences must be made up \u201ctime for time\u201d; i.e. a student wishing to make up one absence in one class must make up 90 minutes. 2. Assignments may be made up within five days of the end of the grading period (prior to exams). The principal (designee) may allow additional make-up time to students with extenuating circumstances. 3. It is the responsibility of the student to arrange to make up time and work. 4. Upon successful completion of make-up time/assignment, the student shall receive the grade earned. 5. The work assigned for make-up time will be supervised by a certified teacher or approved substitute teacher or an alternate plan approved by the principal. 6. Assignments given for/during make-up time shall be appropriate for the class(es) missed. 7. The student will be required to sign in and sign out of the make-up session. II. Tardiness and Early Departures Tardiness is defined as arriving to class or school after the scheduled time for class or school to begin. A tardy is considered \u201cunexcused\u201d unless there is a valid reason for being late. Valid reasons for being late include, but are not limited to, the reasons for an excused absence as defined above as well as circumstances beyond the control of the student, such as when a teacher or staff member detains a student. Early departure is defined as the removal of a student from school prior to the end of the instructional day without a valid reason for an excused absence as defined above.

ANNUAL NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS The superintendent or designee shall provide eligible students and parents with annual notification of their rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The school district does not have to individually notify parents or eligible students of their rights, but must provide the notice in a manner reasonably likely to inform the parents and eligible students of their rights. Effective notice must be provided to parents or eligible students who are disabled or whose primary or home language is not English. The notice must contain all information required by federal law and regulations including the following: 1. the right to inspect and review the student\u2019s educational records and the procedure for exercising this right; 2. the right to request amendment of the student\u2019s educational records that the parent or eligible student believes to be inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student\u2019s privacy rights; and the procedure for exercising this right; 3. the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student\u2019s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent; 4. the type of information designated as directory information and the right to opt out of release of directory information; 5. that the school system releases records to other institutions that have requested the information and in which the student seeks or intends to enroll; 6. the right to opt out of releasing the student\u2019s name, address and phone number to military recruiters or institutions of higher education that request such information; 7. a specification of the criteria for determining who constitutes a school official and what constitutes a legitimate educational interest if a school official discloses or intends to disclose personally identifiable information to school officials without consent; and 8. notification if the school system uses contractors, consultants, volunteers, or similar persons as school officials to perform certain school system services and functions that it would otherwise perform itself; and 9. the right to file complaints with the Family Policy Compliance Office in the U.S. Department of Education. [Type here] 1 [Type here] Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700 B. Definition of Parent and Eligible Student 1. Parent For purposes of this policy, the term \u201cparent\u201d includes a natural parent, a guardian or an individual acting as a parent in the absence of a parent or guardian. If the parents of a student are separated or divorced, both parents have the right to access the student\u2019s records as provided in this policy, unless the school system has been provided with evidence that there is a court order, state statute or other legally binding document that specifically revokes these rights. 2. Eligible Student For purposes of this policy, an eligible student is a student who has reached 18 years of age or is attending an institution of postsecondary education. The rights afforded to parents under this policy transfer to an eligible student. However, parents may still have access to the records as long as the student is claimed as a dependent by the parent for federal income tax purposes. An eligible student wishing to prevent access to records by his or her parents must furnish to the principal information verifying that the student is not a dependent of his or her parents. If a parent of a student who is at least 18 and no longer attending a school within the system wishes to inspect and review the student\u2019s records, he or she must provide information verifying that the student is a dependent for federal income tax purposes. A student under age 18 may have access to student records only upon the consent of his or her parents. C. CLASSIFICATION AND MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS Information about students that is collected and stored by school personnel may be separated into several categories including, but not limited to, the following records. 1. Cumulative Records The cumulative record is the official record for each student. The cumulative record includes student identification information, such as the student\u2019s name, address, or a homeless student\u2019s living situation, sex, race, birthplace and birth date; family data including the parents\u2019 names, addresses, work and home telephone numbers, and places of employment grades; standardized test scores; health screenings and immunization documentation; attendance records; withdrawal and reentry records; discipline records; honors and activities; class rank; date of graduation; and follow up records. [Type here] 2 [Type here] Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700 2. Discipline Records Student discipline records are part of the student\u2019s official record and must be maintained and reviewed pursuant to policy 4345, Student Discipline Records. Discipline records must be expunged and forwarded pursuant to the requirements of law and the procedures of policy 4345. 3. Records of Students with Disabilities Students with recognized disabilities must be accorded all rights in regard to their records as provided by state and federal law, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and policy 3520, Special Education Programs/Rights of Students with Disabilities. Records for a student identified as a student with a disability are considered part of the student\u2019s official records and must be maintained in accordance with all appropriate federal and state regulations. Access to these records will be restricted to personnel having specific responsibility in this area. A list of all approved personnel having access to these restricted files will be updated as needed, and a current, dated list will be posted in the student records location. 4. Records Received form the Department of Social Services The Department of Social Services may disclose confidential information to the school system in order to protect a juvenile from abuse or neglect. Any confidential information disclosed under these circumstances must remain confidential and may only be redisclosed for purposes directly connected with carrying out the school system\u2019s mandated educational responsibilities. 5. Juvenile Records Juvenile records include documentation or information regarding students who are under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. These records may be received from local law enforcement and/or other local agencies authorized to share information concerning juveniles in accordance with G. S. 7B-3100. These records also may include notice from the sheriff to the board that a student has been required to register with the sheriff because the student has been found to be a danger to the community under G.S. Chapter 14, Part 4. Such documents must not be a part of a student\u2019s official records but must be maintained by the principal in a safe, locked storage that is separate from the student\u2019s other records. The principal shall not make a copy of such documents under any circumstances. Juvenile records will be used only to protect the safety of or to improve the educational opportunities for the student or others. The principal may share juvenile records with individuals who have (a) direct guidance, teaching or supervisory responsibility for the student and (b) a specific need to know in order to protect the safety of the student and others. Persons provided access to juvenile records must indicate in writing that they have read the document(s) and agree to maintain [Type here] 3 [Type here] Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700 confidentiality of the records.

If the student is transferring, the principal shall provide the juvenile court counselor with the name and address of the school to which the student is transferring. 6. Other Student Records School system personnel may also keep other student records but must review such records annually and destroy them when their usefulness is no longer apparent or when the student leaves the school system. 7. Sole Possession, Employment and Law Enforcement Records Student records do not include, and release of information under this policy does not apply to: a. records made by teachers, counselors and administrators that are in the sole possession of the maker thereof and that are not accessible or revealed to any other person except a substitute; b. employment records of student employees if those records relate exclusively to the student in his or her capacity as an employee and are not made available for any other use; and c. records created by a law enforcement unit of the school system if created for a law enforcement purpose and maintained solely by the law enforcement unit of the school system.

The parent or eligible student may formally review the student\u2019s complete records only in the presence of the principal or a designee competent to explain the records. School personnel shall not destroy any educational records if there is an outstanding request to inspect or review the records. A parent or eligible student has the right to challenge an item in the student record believed to be inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the student\u2019s privacy rights. The principal shall examine a request to amend a student record item and respond in writing to the person who challenges the item. Subsequent steps, if necessary, will follow the student grievance procedures as provided in policy 1740/4010, Student and Parent Grievance Procedure. If the final decision is that the information in the record is not inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of the student, the principal shall inform the parent or eligible student of the right to place a statement in the record commenting on the contested information in the record or stating why he or she disagrees with the decision of the school system. H. RELEASE OR DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS TO OTHERS Before releasing or disclosing records as permitted by law, school officials shall use Reasonable methods to identify and authenticate the identity of the party to whom the records are disclosed. 1.

The written permission must specify the records to be released, the purpose of the release, and the party(ies) to whom they are to be released. 2. Release/Disclosure without Parental Consent [Type here] 6 [Type here] Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700 School system officials shall promptly release student records when a student transfers to another school. The records custodian may release or disclose records with personally identifiable information without parental permission to the extent permitted by law, including to other school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the records. When personally identifiable information from a student\u2019s records is released without prior written consent of the parent or eligible student, the party to whom the information is released must agree not to disclose the information to any other party without the prior consent of the parent or eligible student. This restriction does not apply to the release of directory information, release of information to parents of non-eligible students, release of information to parents of dependent students, or release of information in accordance with a court order or subpoena. The superintendent shall employ reasonable methods to ensure that teachers and other school officials obtain access only to those educational records in which they have legitimate educational interests. 3. Release of Directory Information Permission of the parent or eligible student is not required for the release of information that is designated as directory information by the board, provided that the parent or eligible student has been given proper notice and an opportunity to opt out. (See policy 1310/4002, Parental Involvement. a.

[Type here] 7 [Type here] Avery County Schools Policy Code: 4700 c. Information about a homeless student\u2019s living situation is ot considered directory information and will not be released. d. As required by law, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of secondary school students shall be released, upon request, to military recruiters or institutions of higher learning, whether or not such information is designated directory information by the school system. Students or their parents, however, may request that the student\u2019s name, address, and telephone number not be released without prior written parental consent. School officials shall notify parents of the option to make a request and shall comply with any requests made. e. All requests for directory information must be submitted to the superintendent or designee for approval. The superintendent is directed to establish regulations regarding the release of directory information. At a minimum, the regulations must: 1. specify the types of organizations that are eligible to receive directory information and for what purposes; 2. provide for equal disclosure to organizations that are similar in purpose; and 3. authorize access to directory information to recruiters of military forces of the state or United States for the purpose of informing students of educational and career opportunities available in the military to the same extent that such information is made available to persons or organizations that inform students of occupational or educational options. 4. Records of Students with Disabilities Students with recognized disabilities must be accorded all rights in regard to their records as provided by state and federal law, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 5. Disclosure of De-Identified Information Education records may be released without consent of the parent or eligible student if all personally identifiable information has been removed.

This policy addresses service animals by any member of the public at a school event in which the general public are invited as well as students using a service animal during the instructional day. SERVICE ANIMALS AT EVENT OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC There is no explicit statutory right for a disabled person to be accompanied by a service animal in a schools. However, ACS does believe that \u201cevery person with a disability has the right to be accompanied by a trained service animal to assist the person with his or her specific disability\u201d in certain places. The public places covered by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 168-3, 4.2 are public transportation and places of public accommodation to which the general public are invited. These statutes do not specifically refer to schools. However, when a school is being used for an event in which the general public is invited. (i.e. concerts, athletic event), the school will allow members of the general public to be accompanied by a registered service animal or a legitimate service animal that meets the definition as set forth by the American with Disabilities Act. If the service animal is in training, the animal must be accompanied by the animal's trainer and the animal must wear a leash, collar harness or cape that identifies that the animal as a service animal in training. The owner of a service animal or the trainer of an animal shall be liable for any damages caused by the animal while on school property. If a service animal becomes unruly or threatens the safety of anyone participating in the event, school officials may require that the animal leave school premises. SERVICE ANIMALS AND STUDENTS During the instructional day, school is not a place where the general public is invited. Therefore, Avery County Schools will review requests to use service animals by students during the instructional day or on the school bus on a case by case basis and any decisions will be based on the individualized needs of the student. For students with an IEP Plan, the decision will be made by the student's respective IEP or 504 Team, Subject to any appeal rights sent forth in the law or Board policy. The decision to allow a student to use a service animal during the instructional day or on a school bus will be determined as set forth by the applicable federal law (Section 504, IDEA, ADA) as well as the other considerations below. The Team shall consider any and all relevant information about the animal and the need for the animal. The team should also consider the following factors: 1. the purpose of the animal and whether the purpose may be accomplished in another, less intrusive manner; Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7321R Page 1 of 4 2. whether the use of an animal would require a change in placement; 3. whether the animal would create an unreasonable disruption to the school environment; 4. whether the animal poses an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of students and staff. DEFINITION OF SERVICE ANIMAL Avery County Schools follows the definition of a service dog as outlined in the ADA. A service animal is not a pet. The ADA defines a service animal as an animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. If they meet this definition, animals are considered service animals under the ADA regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government. Service animals perform some of the functions and tasks that the individual with a disability cannot perform for him or herself. Guide dogs are one type of service animal, used by some individuals who are blind. This is the type of service animal with which most people are familiar. But there are service animals that assist persons with other kinds of disabilities in their day-to-day activities. Some examples include: \u2022 Alerting persons with hearing impairments to sounds. \u2022 Pulling wheelchairs or carrying and picking up things for persons with mobility impairments. \u2022 Assisting persons with mobility impairments with balance. Service animal means an animal trained to accompany its owner or handler for the purpose of carrying items, retrieving objects, pulling a wheelchair, alerting the owner, or handler to medical conditions, or other such activities of service or support necessary to mitigate the disability. GUIDELINES FOR STUDENT USE OF SERVICE ANIMALS There are certain guidelines that need to be followed if, after review, the review team feels that a student is entitled to bring a service animal to school during the instructional day: \u2022 The service animal must be a certified/licensed service animal. \u2022 The service animal\u2019s owner must provide, upon written request, veterinary care and vaccination records. \u2022 The service animal must be under the control of the handler (leashed, harnessed). \u2022 The service animal must be \u201chousebroken\u201d. \u2022 The presence of a service animal must not alter the fundamental nature of the classroom routine. \u2022 The service animal does not substantially interfere with the rights of other students and staff. \u2022 The parent or handler is responsible for the health, condition and bodily functions of the animal. \u2022 The animal is clean, well-groomed and does not have an offensive odor. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7321R Page 2 of 4 \u2022 The animal does not urinate or defecate in inappropriate locations. \u2022 The animal does not solicit attention, visit or annoy any member of the student body or school personnel. \u2022 The animal does not vocalize unnecessarily, i.e., barking, growling or whining. \u2022 The animal shows no aggression towards people or other animals. \u2022 The animal does not solicit or steal food or other items from the student body or school personnel. \u2022 The service animal must not in any other way interfere with the educational process of any student. \u2022 The service animal must not pose a health or safety threat to any student, personnel or other persons. \u2022 The owner of the service animal must provide proof of liability insurance that will cover any damage done by the animal. The owner of the service animal will be liable for any damage caused by the animal. STANDARDS BY WHICH THE REQUEST WILL BE EVALUATED The animal must be a trained service animal. A \"trained service animal\" can be called a: \u2022 hearing animal \u2022 guide animal \u2022 assistance animal \u2022 seizure alert animal \u2022 mobility animal \u2022 autism service animal A \"trained service animal\" is NOT called a: \u2022 skilled companion animal \u2022 therapy animal \u2022 social animal \u2022 facility animal \u2022 agility animal \u2022 helping animal \u2022 support animal The service animal must have a health certificate that evidences the animal is currently in good health, free from parasites, and has received all recommended vaccinations. Guide dogs for totally or partially blind persons and hearing dogs for deaf or hearing impaired or otherwise disabled persons must wear a harness, backpack, or vest identifying the dog as a trained service dog. The service animal and its primary handler must be certified for \"public access\". Any purported service animal that is being brought into a school setting must have sufficient training to be certifiable for public access. Having \"Public Access\" is an important, objective measure of the animal's ability to behave appropriately in public and the handler's ability to handle the service animal in public. If the handler cannot produce such a certificate, then either the animal must pass the ADI Public Access Test or the Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7321R Page 3 of 4 handler must produce credible proof that the dog has met ADI's \"Minimum Standards for Training Service Animals.\" Costs associated with the certification are the responsibility of the parent(s). Even if the service animal is certified for public access, it will be denied access to school property if at any time ADI's \"Minimum Standards For Assistance Animals in Public\" are not maintained.

An automated external defibrillator (AED) will be used to treat victims who experience sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). It will be applied only to victims who are unconscious, without a pulse and not breathing. The AED will analyze the heart rhythm and advise the operator if a shockable rhythm is detected. If a shockable rhythm is detected, the AED will charge to the appropriate energy level and advise the operator to deliver a shock. There will be a medical advisor to the AED program. The medical advisor of the AED program will be responsible for providing medical direction for use of AEDs, writing a prescription for AEDs, reviewing and approving guidelines for emergency procedures related to use of AEDs and CPR, and evaluation of post-\u00ad\u2010event review forms and digital files downloaded form the AED. Authorized AED Users The AED may be used by all members of the school\u2019s medical emergency response team (MERT) who have successfully completed training and/or any trained team member (volunteer responder) who has successfully completed an approved CPR +AED training program within the last two years and has a current successful course completion card. The school nurses will be responsible for making training available by American Heart Association (AHA) or American Red Cross (ARC) for designated or volunteer staff. Responsibilities The AED trained employee will be responsible for activating the internal emergency response system and providing prompt basic life support (including AED and first aid) according to training and experience. The trainer will also understand and comply with the requirements of this policy and will follow the more detailed procedures and guidelines for the AED program. Anyone can, at his/her discretion, provide voluntary assistance to victims of medical emergencies. The extent to which these individuals respond shall be appropriate to their training and experience. These responders are encouraged to contribute to emergency response only to the extent they are comfortable in doing. The emergency medical response of these individuals may include CPR, AED or medical first aid. The school office staff will be responsible for receiving emergency medical calls from the internal location using an established 9-\u00ad\u20101-\u00ad\u20101 checklist to assess the emergency and determine the appropriate level of response. The office staff will contact the external community 911 response ream (EMS) if required. The office staff will then deploy the AED-\u00ad\u2010trained employees to the emergency location. Someone will be assigned to meet the responding EMS aid vehicle and direct EMS personnel to the site of the medical emergency. During school hours, the AED will be at designated locations. These locations shall be specific to each school but should allow staff members to retrieve the device outside of normal school hours. After school hours, the AED may be moved from its designated location by an AED-\u00ad\u2010 trained athletic trainer to support athletic department activities on a voluntary basis. Trained personnel may be available to support this effort during non-\u00ad\u2010school hours. A visible sign will be left in the place of the AED, with the phone number to the athletic trainer, clearly indicating they have possession of the AED. Contracted and other community activities will not be guaranteed access to the AED as part of standard rental contracts. Nothing in this policy should be construed to require the presence or use of an AED on school property or at school sponsored events, unless otherwise required by law. The board cannot and does not guarantee that an AED or a person trained in its use will be available at any particular school site or school-\u00ad\u2010 sponsored event.

Procedures are used in order to protect students from intentional exposure to allergens and to prepare staff to deal with allergic reactions if they occur. It is the responsibility of parents of a student with a life-threatening allergy to a food to provide the school principal with documentation from a licensed health care provider of the specific allergic condition of the child. The school nurse will work with the parents to develop a health care plan and an emergency plan (in the event of an allergic reaction) in order to minimize the specific risks to the student. Schools at which there is a student who has provided documentation of a life-threatening food allergy will provide a table in the cafeteria that is to be kept free of the types of allergen(s) that impact the identified students(s). All school staff who have contact with a child with life-threatening allergies to foods will be made aware of the child\u2019s emergency plan and trained to recognize the symptoms of and respond to an allergic reaction. It is impossible to create an allergen-free environment. To create the illusion that the school environment is free of allergens would be misleading and potentially harmful.

The board further recognizes that student wellness and proper nutrition are related to a student\u2019s physical well being, growth, development and readiness to learn. The board is committed to providing a school environment that promotes student wellness, proper nutrition, nutrition education and regular physical activity as part of the total learning experience. As part of that commitment, the board directs the superintendent to oversee the development, implementation, and ongoing evaluation of this policy and other school system efforts to encourage students to be healthy and active, including compliance with the State Board of Education\u2019s Healthy Active Children Policy, SHLT-000, as further described in Section F, below. The superintendent may designate a school system official to carry out this responsibility (\u201clead wellness official\u201d). The superintendent or designee shall make the most current version of this policy available to members of the school community and the public by posting it on the school system website and/or by distributing it annually through other means reasonably intended to reach the school community and public. In addition, the superintendent or designee shall provide a copy of this policy to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) when requested to do so. A. SCHOOL HEALTH ADVISORY COUNCIL The School Health Advisory Council will help plan, update, implement, promote, and monitor this policy as well as to address other health and nutrition issues within the school system. The council serves as an advisory committee regarding student health issues and works in conjunction with the lead wellness official charged with oversight of this policy and the school system\u2019s efforts to promote student and employee health and wellness in compliance with the state and federal requirements. The council is authorized to examine related research and laws, assess student needs and the current school environment, review existing board policies and administrative regulations, collaborate with appropriate community agencies and organizations, and help raise awareness about student health issues. The council also may make policy recommendations to the board related to this policy and other policies concerning student wellness and, in conjunction with the lead wellness official, shall periodically review and suggest revisions to this policy. In addition, the council may assist in the development of a plan for measuring and assessing implementation of this policy and in developing methods to inform and update the public about the content and implementation of this policy as described in Sections F and G, below. The council will be composed of representatives from the school system, the local health department, and the community. The council must include members of each of the following groups: the school board, school system administrators, Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140 Page 1 of 10 school system food service representatives, physical education teachers, school health professionals, students, parents or guardians, and the public. The council will provide information in the following areas or concerns: (1) physical activity, (2) health education, (3) employee wellness, (4) health services, (5) social and emotional climate, (6) nutrition environment and services, (7) counseling, psychological, and social services, (8) physical environment, (9) family engagement, and (10) community involvement.

In addition, the council will assist the lead wellness official in creating an annual report which includes the minutes of physical activity and the minutes of physical education and/or healthful living education received by students in the district each school year, and any other information required by the State Board of Education or NCDPI. B. NUTRITION PROMOTION AND NUTRITION EDUCATION The board believes that promoting student health and nutrition enhances readiness for learning and increases student achievement. The general goals of nutrition promotion and nutrition education are (1) to provide appropriate instruction for the acquisition of behaviors that contribute to a healthy lifestyle for students and (2) to teach, encourage and support healthy eating by students. The ACS Annual Report shall show measureable goals for nutrition promotion and nutrition education. The board will provide nutrition education within the Healthful Living Standard Course of Study and the grade level expectations outlined in the Healthful Living Essential Standards adopted by the State Board of Education. Nutrition education should be designed to provide all students with the knowledge and skills needed to lead healthy lives. Students should learn to address nutrition-related health concerns through age-appropriate nutrition education lessons and activities. Nutrition education should extend beyond the school environment by engaging and involving families and communities. School district personnel may coordinate with agencies and community organizations to provide opportunities for appropriate student projects related to nutrition. School district personnel will work to disseminate consistent nutrition messages throughout the school district, schools, classrooms, school dining areas, homes, community and media. In conjunction with the school health advisory council, the board establishes the following additional specific evidence-based goals and strategies for nutrition promotion and education. The board will periodically measure and report progress toward meeting these goals. \u2022 Nutrition education that aligns with national dietary guidelines and adheres to state academic standards will be incorporated into health education classes and/or stand-alone courses for all grade levels. The nutrition curriculum will encompass: o promotion of adequate nutrient intake and healthy eating practices; Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140 Page 2 of 10 o skill development, such as meal planning, recognizing food groups within a meal, and understanding health information and food labels to evaluate the nutrient content and contribution of foods; o study of the problems associated with food marketing to children; and o food safety. \u2022 Employees will use only approved nutrition curriculum in the classroom. Curriculum developed by corporate interests will not be used unless it meets curricular standards. \u2022 Teachers will integrate nutrition education into core curriculum areas such as math, science, social studies, and language arts, as well as in non-core and elective subjects. \u2022 Nutrition promotion will include participatory activities such as contests, surveys, promotions, voting for school meal recipe names, cafeteria design or d\u00e9cor challenges, farm visits, and experience working in school gardens. \u2022 The nutrition education program will be linked to school meal programs, school gardens, cafeteria nutrition promotions, and farm-to-school programs. \u2022 Nutrition education will be provided to families via handouts, newsletters, website posts, presentations, and workshops. The school menu will be posted online. \u2022 Nutrition education will be offered in the cafeteria as well as the classroom, with coordination between the foodservice staff and teachers. \u2022 Nutrition education will promote fruits, vegetables, whole-grain products, healthy food preparation methods, and accurate portion sizes. \u2022 School nutrition program staff at each school will employ at least three tools or strategies suggested in the USDA \u201cSmarter Lunchrooms\u201d publication (available at http://healthymeals.nal.usda.gov/healthierus- school-challenge-resources/smarter-lunchrooms) to increase student participation in the federal school lunch and breakfast programs and to encourage students to make healthy food choices. \u2022 Nutrition and health posters, signage, and/or displays will be exhibited in the cafeteria food service and dining areas, classrooms, hallways, gymnasium, and/or bulletin boards and will be frequently rotated, updated, or changed. \u2022 Students will have opportunities to taste foods that are low in saturated and trans fats, sodium, and added sugar. \u2022 Families will be requested to pack lunches and snacks that meet school system nutrition standards and will be provided with written guidance on how to accomplish this. \u2022 School personnel will strive to provide a pleasant eating experience for students and adults by adopting the following practices: o Student input is solicited for meal choices. o Nutrient analysis is available to teachers, parents, students, and health professionals when possible. o Adequate time to eat is provided. The recommended eating time for each child after being served is 15 minutes for breakfast and 20 Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140 Page 3 of 10 minutes lunch. School personnel will schedule enough time, lunch periods, and serving lines so students do not have to spend excessive time waiting in line. o Adult supervision and role modeling are available during the meal service times to encourage students to eat meals. o Drinking fountains will be available for students to get water at meals and throughout the day. \u2022 As marketing/advertising tools (kiosks, vending machines, signage, etc.) are replaced within the LEA, new tools will promote foods and/or beverages that are consistent with the Smart Snacks nutrition standards and the school nutrition meal pattern requirements. \u2022 In negotiating vendor contracts, preference will be given to vendors whose marketing and advertising tools reflect the Smart Snacks nutrition standards and the school nutrition meal pattern requirements. \u2022 The LEA will collaborate with vendors to gradually replace or modify vending machines to ensure all signage for the machine promotes products that are consistent with the Smart Snacks nutrition standards and the school nutrition meal pattern. C. PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 1. Goals of the Physical Education Program The goal of the physical education program is to promote lifelong physical activity and provide instruction in the skills and knowledge necessary for lifelong participation in physical activity. To address issues such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and Type II diabetes, students enrolled in kindergarten through eighth grades must have the opportunity to participate in physical activity as part of the district\u2019s physical education curriculum. 2. The Physical Education Course The physical education course should be designed to foster support and guidance for being physically active, help students know and understand the value of being physically fit, and teach students the types of activities that contribute to total fitness. The course is to be taught in an environment where students can learn, practice and receive assessment on developmentally appropriate skills and knowledge as defined in the North Carolina Healthful Living Standard Course of Study. Students should be engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity for fifty percent or more of class time. The goal is for physical education classes to be equivalent in size to those of other academic classes. 3. Physical Activity Requirements and Goals School personnel should strive to provide opportunities for age- and developmentally-appropriate physical activity during the day for all students so that students can learn to exhibit a physically active lifestyle. A minimum of 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity will be provided daily by schools for kindergarten through eighth-grade students. Such activity may be achieved through a regular daily physical education class, recess, dance, classroom energizers and/or other curriculum-based physical activity programs of at least 10 minutes duration, that, when combined, total 30 minutes of daily Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140 Page 4 of 10 physical activity. Principals shall work with teachers to ensure that students meet the minimum physical activity requirement. The board will periodically measure and report progress toward meeting these goals. To ensure that students have ongoing opportunities for physical activity and maintain a positive attitude towards physical activity, structured/unstructured recess and other physical activity shall not be taken away from students as a form of punishment. In addition, severe and inappropriate exercise may not be used as a form of punishment for students. In conjunction with the school health advisory council, the board establishes the following additional specific evidence-based goals and strategies for physical activity: \u2022 Middle and high schools will provide extra-curricular activities that enable students to select from a variety of sports and other active endeavors. \u2022 Elementary students will be provided the opportunity to participate in daily recess. \u2022 Classroom health education will reinforce the knowledge and skills needed to maintain a physically active lifestyle. \u2022 Students will be encouraged to reduce sedentary time and will not be required to engage in sedentary activities for more than two hours without an opportunity to stretch and move around. \u2022 Short (3-5 minute) physical activity breaks will be provided between classes in elementary schools. \u2022 Teachers will incorporate opportunities for physical activity in the classroom whenever possible. \u2022 Schools will provide annual fitness testing for all students and provide confidential reports directly to parents. D. NUTRITION STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES FOR ALL FOOD AND BEVERAGES AVAILABLE AT SCHOOL Consistent with policy 6200, Goals of School Nutrition Services, all foods available in the district\u2019s schools during the school day that are offered to students should help promote student health, reduce childhood obesity, provide a variety of nutritional meals, and promote lifelong healthy eating habits. All foods and beverages sold at school must meet the nutrition standards established in policy 6230, School Meal and Competitive Foods Standards, including the following: 1. School Lunch, Breakfast, and Snack Programs Foods provided through the National School Lunch, School Breakfast, or After School Snack Programs must comply with federal and state nutrition standards. The director of child nutrition shall ensure that school system guidelines issued for reimbursable meals are not less restrictive than regulations and guidelines issued for schools in accordance with federal law. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140 Page 5 of 10 2. Competitive Foods All foods sold on school campuses in areas that are accessible to students during the school day (defined as the period from midnight through 30 minutes after the dismissal bell rings) in competition with the National School Lunch or School Breakfast Programs (\u201ccompetitive foods\u201d) must comply with the federal Smart Snacks in Schools standards. Vending machine sales also must comply with the requirements of G.S. 115C-264.2 and Eat Smart: North Carolina\u2019s Recommended Standards for All Foods in Schools. Competitive foods include food, snacks and beverages from a la carte menus, vending machines and outside suppliers, as well as foods or beverages sold in school stores and at fund-raisers. 3. Other Foods Available on the School Campus During the School Day and After the School Day School principals shall establish rules for foods and beverages brought from home for classroom events or parties during the school day or for extracurricular activities after the school day. The board encourages principals to establish rules that are consistent with the Smart Snacks in Schools standards. Fundraising activities that involve the sale of foods and/or beverages to students during the school day (from midnight until 30 minutes after the dismissal bell rings) must comply with the Smart Snack Rules and may not be conducted until after the end of the last lunch period. (See policy 6230, School Meal and Competitive Foods Standards.) School principals may establish standards for fundraising activities conducted after the school day (beginning 31 minutes after the dismissal bell rings) that involve the sale of food and/or beverages. The board encourages alternative fundraising activities such as non-food items or physical activity. 4. Food and Beverage Marketing Food and beverage marketing on school campuses during the school day must meet federal and state standards. In accordance with these standards, only foods and beverages that meet the Smart Snack standards (as described in subsection C.2. above) may be marketed or advertised on school campuses during the school day. To comply with this requirement, existing supplies, materials, or equipment that depict noncompliant products or logos will be replaced or removed in accordance with normal lifecycles or as otherwise would occur in the normal course of business. E. OTHER SCHOOL-BASED ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE WELLNESS In addition to the standards discussed above, the board adopts the following goals for school-based activities designed to promote wellness: 1. Schools will provide a clean and safe meal environment. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6140 Page 6 of 10 2. Students will be provided adequate time to eat meals. 3. Drinking water will be available at all meal periods and throughout the school day. 4. Professional development will be provided for district nutrition staff. 5. To the extent possible, the district will utilize available funding and outside programs to enhance student wellness. 6. Food will not be used in the schools as a reward or punishment. 7. As appropriate, the goals of this wellness policy will be considered in planning all school-based activities. 8.

All federal and state revenues will be accepted and applied so as to maximize the use of such funds for the purposes of providing nutritional meals to students at the lowest possible price. A. Operational Standards The student nutrition services program will be operated in a manner consistent with board goals and board policy. The program also will be operated in compliance with all applicable state and federal law, including requirements of the National School Lunch Program and all federal guidelines established by the Child Nutrition Division of the United States Department of Agriculture. Specific legal requirements which must be met include, but are not limited to, the following. School officials may not discriminate based on race, sex, color, national origin, or disability, age or eligibility status for free and reduced-price meals. School officials are also prohibited from retaliating against an individual for prior civil rights activity. The school nutrition services program will meet safety and sanitation requirements established in local, state and federal rules and guidelines for school nutrition service programs. The school nutrition services program will have a written food safety program that includes a hazard analysis critical control point plan for each school. Menu preparation, purchasing, and related record keeping will be consistent with applicable state and federal rules and guidelines. Banking, financial record keeping, budgeting and accounting will be conducted in accordance with generally accepted practices and procedures, as dictated by the School Budget and Fiscal Control Act and in accordance with state and federal guidelines. Commodity foods donated by the United States Department of Agriculture will be used and accounted for in accordance with federal regulations; Preference will be given in purchasing contracts to high-calcium foods and beverages, as defined in G.S. 115C-264-1 and to foods grown or raised within North Carolina. Child Nutrition Program (CNP) funds will be used only for the purposes authorized by law. Indirect costs, as defined by law, will not be assessed to the CNP unless the program Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6220 Page 1 of 3 has a minimum of one month\u2019s operating balance. The price for meals will be determined in accordance with federal law. Nonprogram foods will be priced to generate sufficient revenues to cover the cost of those items. A non-program food is defined as a food or beverage, other than a reimbursable meal or snack, that is sold at the school and is purchased using funds from the child nutrition account. All school food services are operated on a nonprofit basis for the benefit of the Child Nutrition Program (CNP). School nutrition services are those that are operated from 12:01 a.m. until the end of the last lunch period. All income from the sale of all foods and beverages that is required by law or regulation to be retained by the CNP will be deposited into the CNP account and will be used only for the purposes of the school\u2019s nonprofit lunch and breakfast programs All funds from food and beverage sales not otherwise required by law to be deposited to the CNP account will be deposited into the proper school account in accordance with guidelines developed by the superintendent or designee. All competitive foods sold on school campuses will meet federal and state standards for nutrient content. B. Meal Charges Students who are required to pay for meals are expected to provide payment in a timely manner. The board recognizes, however, that students occasionally may forget or lose their meal money. The board therefore directs the superintendent to develop a procedure to manage situations in which students are unable to pay for a meal on a particular day. To safeguard the dignity and confidentiality of students in the serving line, reasonable efforts must be used whenever possible to avoid calling attention to a student\u2019s inability to pay. The superintendent shall ensure that federal child nutrition funds are not used to offset the cost of unpaid meals and that the CNP is reimbursed for uncollected student meal charges prior to the end of the year. The child nutrition director and principal shall work jointly to prevent meal charges from accumulating and shall make every effort to collect all funds due to the child nutrition program on a regular basis and before the end of the school term. Notices of negative balances in a child\u2019s meal account will be sent to the parents and the principal at regular intervals during the school year. This policy and any applicable procedures regarding meal charges must be communicated to school administrators, school food service professional, parents, and students. A written copy of the meal charges policy is available on the ACS website or upon request at any school. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6220 Page 2 of 3 The superintendent or designee will establish procedures as appropriate to help ensure compliance with board policy and legal requirements.

The board strives to meet the needs of students and to comply with the laws. 1. Due to reporting requirements, the Child Nutrition Program cannot permit charging of meals. Customers may, however, pay for meals in advance or borrow money provided by the school principal. Further, Federal policy prohibits the withholding of meals from a child as a form of discipline. 2. Supplemental sale items may not be charged. 3. No adults will be allowed to charge meals, pre-payment is suggested. The Child Nutrition Program exists principally to provide meals to students ages 4-21, it is inappropriate to allow adults who are employed by the LEA to charge meals to the Child Nutrition Program as this practice uses the Federal funds earmarked for children to financially benefit adults and is, therefore, not allowed. (OMB A-87 Circular). Procedures No student will be deprived a meal nor served a differentiated meal (i.e. peanut butter/jelly or cheese sandwich) due to forgotten or lost money. At no time will a student\u2019s meal be retrieved once the student has received a tray of food. The student shall be allowed to eat the meal and the student\u2019s account will be debited. The funds borrowed from the Child Nutrition Program that have been debited from the student's account must be repaid by the end of the school year. Students will be responsible for repaying all loaned money to the school cafeteria. A note shall be given to the student by the cafeteria cashier to take home or be mailed to the student's home to inform the parent that the child owes money on their lunch account. Principals will assist with the collection if other attempts fail. The principal will be given a list of students with charges on a weekly basis, so they are aware of the charges incurred in the cafeteria.. If a student is without meal money on a consistent basis, the school is encouraged to investigate the situation more closely, including contacting the parent/guardian to bring money to the school and/or encouraging the parent /guardian to apply for free and reduced meals. To prevent the Child Nutrition from closing the year with unpaid balances, all loaned money must be collected before the close of the school year. End of year procedures are as follows: 1. No loans will be allowed during the last two weeks of school; 2. All bills will be sent home to parents requesting payment; and 3. The principal will assist in collecting these funds. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6221 All school cafeterias are computerized with point of sale/cash register systems. It is recommended that parents be informed that meals can be paid for in advance in the cafeteria or online through lunch prepay. They should be encouraged to maintain funds in their child's account so as to minimize the possibility that the child may be without meal money on any given day. The computer system will maintain a record of all monies depostied and spent for each student. A copy of this report will be available to parents upon request.

Because employees and students depend on these systems to assist with teaching and learning and because sensitive and confidential information may be stored on these systems, system integrity and security is of utmost importance. A. NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY The school system information technology systems are valuable assets that must be protected. To this end, school technology personnel shall evaluate each information technology asset and assign protective controls that are commensurate with the established value of such assets. Appropriate security measures must be in place to protect all information technology assets from accidental or unauthorized use, theft, modification or destruction and to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of restricted information. Network security measures must include an information technology system disaster recovery process. Audits of security measures must be conducted annually. All personnel shall ensure the protection and security of information technology assets that are under their control. B. SECURITY AWARENESS The technology director or designee shall provide employees with information to enhance awareness regarding technology security threats and to educate them about appropriate safeguards, network security and information security. C. MALWARE PROTECTION Malware detection programs and practices must be implemented throughout the school system. The superintendent or designee is responsible for ensuring that the school system network includes current software to prevent the introduction or propagation of computer malware. D. TRAINING FOR USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES Users should be trained as necessary to effectively use technological resources effectively ad in a manner that maintains the security of the network infrastructure and ensures compliance with state and federal law and regulations. Such training should include information related to remote access, virus protection, the state student information and instructional improvement system applications, network and information security, and other topics deemed necessary by the superintendent or technology director. Training may be conducted as part of the technology-related professional development program (see policy 3220, Technology in the Educational Program). Page 1 of 3 Policy Code: 6524 E. ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS 1. User ID and Password All users of information technology systems must be properly identified and authenticated before being allowed to access such systems. The combination of a unique user identification and a valid password is the minimum requirement for granting access to information technology systems. Depending on the operating environment, information involved and exposure risks, additional or more stringent security practices may be required as determined by the superintendent or technology director. The technology director or designee shall establish password management capabilities and procedures to ensure the security of passwords. 2. Student Information System The technology director or designee shall ensure that any all school system computers with access to the state student information system application pursuant to State Board of Education Policy TCS-C-018 adhere to relevant standards and requirements established by the State Board of Education, including provisions related to the user identification, password and workstation security standards. Employees must follow all such standards for all any computers used to access the student information system, including the employee\u2019s personal computer. 3.

These resources are vital to the instructional program and to the effective and efficient operation of the District. The resources must be protected and secured. Identification and Authentication of Users All users must be properly identified and authenticated before being allowed to access resources and services provided by the ACSNet system. The primary means of identification and authentication used within the ACSNet system is a combination of unique user-id and password. \u2022 A unique user-id will be assigned for each user so that individual accountability can be established for all system activities. \u2022 Administrative approval is required for each user-id creation. User-ids will be created and managed by the Director of Technology Services or by his/her designee. \u2022 A process is established in an administrative procedure to assign, suspend, move or remove user-id accounts. \u2022 A password management procedure is established to ensure the confidentiality of passwords and to prevent exploitation of weak passwords. \u2022 Except as specifically allowed by the ACSNet security administrator, passwords shall not be revealed to anyone, including a supervisor, family members or co-workers. In special cases where a user must divulge a password, such as for system support, the user shall immediately change the password after the purpose for revealing the password has been achieved. Intentionally sharing UserID/Password information with unauthorized persons is a breach of security policy and may result in disciplinary action. \u2022 During a brief period at the start of the first and second semesters of the school year, students may be provided with a \u201cshared\u201d network account to be used only until their personal user-id and password has been created. The shared account will be disabled as soon as all students have been provided with their personal accounts. At no time should staff or faculty use the shared student account. \u2022 Users are responsible for all activities performed under their personal user-id. Workstations must be locked, secured or logged off any time the current user is not in direct control of the computer, e.g. stepping away from one\u2019s desk, lunch break, fire drill, etc. \u2022 Certain software applications use security models and procedures that are separate from the ACSNet user-id/password process. Examples of this situation include NCWise, Follett Library Automation system, GroupWise WebAccess email system and Education Law in North Carolina. User-ids and passwords will be created and maintained for these products with the same emphasis on overall system security as that considered for ACSNet. Procedures describe the method and management of account creation, adherence to required user-id/password parameters and overall management of the product security. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6526 Page 1 of 4 Employee Access to Data Employees shall be given access (assignment of network user-id / password and assignment of appropriate rights) to confidential data only after being provided an opportunity to review the Employee Acceptable Use Policy contained in Policy 3225/7320. It shall be the responsibility of each employee\u2019s supervisor to verify that each employee who accesses information is properly trained and aware of their role and responsibility for maintaining information confidentiality and data security. Employees should save all data to the network storage resource (server) rather than workstation hard-drives. Data saved to a network server is generally far more secure than data saved to a workstation. Data saved to the network is protected by antivirus software and other electronic devices. Workstation hard-drives may not be backed up properly and are far more susceptible to viruses and malware problems than are network servers. Workstations are not generally protected from electrical surges and spikes that cause damage. Security Measures The Information Technology Services department shall implement and utilize a variety of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to and use of ACSNet resources. These measures include firewalls, filters, sniffers, and packet shapers. New tools, as they are developed and become available, may be utilized to prevent security incidents and protect resources. Users should have no expectation of privacy in the material stored, sent or received by them over the ACSNet system. Monitoring of this material may occur to either insure the security and operating performance of the ACSNet system, or to enforce district policies or compliance with state or federal law. Computer Workstation Security Computer workstations used as part of the ACSNet system are the property of Avery County Schools and are provided to staff and students as a resource to accomplish the instructional and administrative goals of the District. In order to maximize the availability of these critical resources, steps are taken to protect the integrity of the operating systems and application software. \u2022 All computer workstations must be protected by a security program that prevents installation and modification of software. The only allowed exceptions are workstations that must run application software required by the District that will not run within the secured environment. \u2022 No user will intentionally defeat or disable the operation of the workstation security software without the prior approval of the Technology Services staff. \u2022 No software may be installed without the prior approval of the Technology Services staff. Software interactions may render vital applications unusable, so new software must installed in a controlled environment before being placed into production. \u2022 Keystroke logging devices and/or software may not be installed without the approval of the Director of Technology Services. \u2022 Remote desktop control software may not be installed without the prior approval of the Director of Technology Services. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6526 Page 2 of 4 \u2022 Operating system software configuration changes may not be made without the prior approval of the Technology Services staff. This includes desktop configurations, screensavers, and other user-controllable applets provided within the operating system. Anti-virus Protection Using internet services, email services and exchanging data between computers exposes the ACSNet system to potentially harmful programs, Trojan horses, worms, and system exploits (collectively, \u201cvirus\u201d or \u201cviruses\u201d). The ACSNet system resources must be protected from disruption caused by these agents. \u2022 The currently adopted antivirus application and current virus definition files for the product will be installed and maintained on all ACSNet workstations. ACSNet users will be instructed on the procedure for using the antivirus product to protect data. \u2022 Operating system and application software patches will be tested and installed as appropriate to protect the operating system and application software from resource exploits. \u2022 An administrative procedure describes the means of notifying users of virus threats, possible infections and methods to be used to identify, contain, remove and recover from virus events. \u2022 No user will intentionally defeat the operation of the antivirus software without the prior approval of the Technology Services Staff. Malware Protection The Information Technology Services department will provide malware protection. This protection may take the form of software, appliances or services that help prevent the proliferation of malware infection within the ACSNet system. These systems will be maintained current within the budgetary constraints of the district. Connecting Unauthorized Devices to the Network Unauthorized equipment (privately owned computers, laptops, wireless access points, switches, mini-hubs, etc.) shall not be connected to the network without the express authorization and approval of the Director of Information Technology Services or his designee.. Network Rights and Access to Network Resources and Services Users of the ACSNet system are provided access to networked resources and denied access to networked resources based on the needs of their educational program in the case of students, or based on their job requirements in the case of staff. Users are provided with only the network rights and access required to meet the needs of the instructional and administrative goals of the District. \u2022 Network rights and access to networked resources will be maintained and managed by the Director of Technology Services or his/her designee. \u2022 Network rights assignments will be periodically audited to ensure the assignments are current and appropriate. \u2022 Requests to change the scope of a user\u2019s network rights will be submitted to the Director of Technology Services. The need for the change must be clearly demonstrated and, in the case of staff, the user\u2019s supervisor must approve the change. \u2022 Network administration rights of varying levels will be granted only to Technology Services staff that have the expertise and the need to manage ACSNet networked resources. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 6526 Page 3 of 4 Remote Access to the ACSNet System Remote access to certain services provided within the ACSNet system may be provided to individuals based on the instructional or administrative need to access such services and on the ability for such services to be provided without compromising the security of the ACSNet system and the data contained therein. Confidentiality of Security Information and Security Measures District personnel shall not make public information concerning its security infrastructure. To do so might breach the security system and jeopardize the confidentiality of employee and student information. Information Technology Security Incidents The Director of Information Technology Services shall establish different levels of security incidents and those incidents serious enough to compromise the integrity of the systems or data shall be investigated. Appropriate action will be taken to eliminate any determined weakness in the security system. High-level security breaches shall be reported to the Superintendent. Technology Services Policies, Regulations, Standards and Guidelines The Director of Information Technology Services may develop and adopt, in accordance with the policies of the Avery County Schools Board of Education, policies, procedures, regulations, standards and guidelines to be followed by all employees and students regarding access to and use of any technology related services and/or equipment that is not specifically addressed here. Areas covered by these internal policies, regulations, standards and guidelines may include hardware and software purchases, equipment maintenance and repair, disaster recovery of data and hardware, web-site management, and password guidelines.

The purpose of this policy is to limit occupational exposure of employees to blood and other potentially infectious body fluids that may transmit bloodborne pathogens. I. Employees Affected All employees who, as a result of performing required job duties, could be \"reasonably anticipated\" to face contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials are covered by the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen Standard and this policy. \"Occupational exposure\" includes any reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parental (brought in the body through some way other than the digestive tract) contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee's duties. According to the North Carolina Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Bloodborne Pathogen Standard (printed 5/92), \"Good Samaritan\" acts such as assisting a co-worker or student with a nose bleed would not be considered \"reasonably anticipated occupational exposure\". Universal precautions shall be in force at all times as follows: in dealing with the cleaning or decontamination of any blood or body fluid. All blood, body fluid, and potentially infectious material shall be handled as if infected. The Board of Education shall adhere to the program standards for the control of potential exposure to HIV and HBV as outlined in the proposed OSHA Rule \"Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens\" standard 1910.1030 (or most current standards available) as well as relevant sections of the North Carolina General Statutes and North Carolina Administrative Code.

This plan should include: methods of compliance (Universal Precautions, engineering and work practice controls, personal protective equipment, cleaning and disposal); HBV vaccinations; hazard communication; record keeping; training; an identification of all job classifications and tasks that involve occupational exposure; and a schedule to meet the activities outlines in the exposure control plan. The Plan is reviewed and updated annually.3. All employees have access to a copy of this \"Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure\" policy and plan, one being placed at the central office and one in each school. Avery County Schools Policy Page 1 of 4 III. Testing and Examination An employee who suspects that he/she has a blood or body fluid exposure may request to be tested at the employer's expense, provided that the suspected exposure poses a significant risk of transmission as defined in the rules of the Health Service Commission. The source individual's tests results will be made available to the exposed employee with or without the source individual's permission, as long as significant risk exposure has occurred (Communicable Disease Control Measure, 15A NCAC 19A.0202(4) and NCAC 19A.0203(b) (3) adopted by the North Carolina Health Services Commission.) The Board shall strictly adhere to existing confidentiality rules and laws regarding employees with communicable diseases, including HIV or HIV-associated conditions. IV. Anti-Discrimination The agency shall not discriminate against any applicant or employee who has or is suspected of having HIV infection, AIDS, or other communicable diseases. An employee with HIV infection, AIDS, or other communicable diseases may continue to work as long as the employee is able to satisfactorily perform the duties of the job and there is no medical evidence indicating that the employee's condition is a \"health threat\" to co-workers, students, or the public.

Many severe allergies are undiagnosed, and students or others may experience their first severe allergic reaction while at school. Epinephrine auto-injector devices can be used to administer epinephrine to provide rapid, convenient first aid for persons suffering a potentially fatal anaphylactic reaction. This policy addresses the use of emergency epinephrine auto-injector devices administered under a non-patient specific prescription. Student-specific orders for epinephrine auto-injector devices are addressed on policy 6125, Administering Medicines to Students. Designated trained school personnel are authorized to use emergency epinephrine auto- injector devices to deliver emergency medical aid to any person suffering from an anaphylactic reaction during the school day or at a school-sponsored event on school property. The superintendent shall ensure that at least two emergency epinephrine auto- injector devices are located at each school for this purpose and are stored in secure, but unlocked and easily accessible, locations. Each school principal shall designate one or more school personnel, as part of the medical care program under G.S. 115C-375.1, to receive initial training and annual retraining from a school nurse or qualified representative of the local health department regarding the storage and emergency use of epinephrine auto-injector devices. Only such trained personnel are authorized to administer epinephrine to persons believed to be having an anaphylactic reaction. The principal shall make reasonable efforts to notify other school staff members as to which employee(s) ha received this training in order to facilitate a prompt emergency response. The principal, in collaboration with appropriate school personnel, shall create an emergency action plan for the use of the epinephrine auto-injector devices that complies with all state law requirements. Principals are encouraged to include in the plan school- wide employee training in recognizing symptoms of anaphylaxis. Epinephrine auto-injector devices provided by the school are intended for unforeseen emergencies. Students known to have medical conditions requiring the availability of an epinephrine auto-injector device are expected to provide such devices for their use at school.

An individual with a disability may be accompanied by his or her service animal on school property subject to the requirements of this policy. If necessary, the superintendent may establish administrative regulations for the use of service animals on school property. A. DEFINITION OF \u201cSERVICE ANIMAL\u201d A \u201cservice animal\u201d for purposes of this policy is any dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including, but not limited to, a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual or other mental disability. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the individual\u2019s disability or necessary to mitigate a disability. Federal regulation 28 C.F.R. 35.104 provides examples of types of work or tasks that would qualify. Service animals do not include any other species of animal, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, except that a miniature horse will be permitted for use as a service animal if reasonable modifications can be made after assessing the specific factors listed in 28 C.F.R. 35.136(i). Animals whose sole function is to provide emotional support, well- being, comfort, companionship, or therapeutic benefits, or to act as a crime deterrent, are not service animals for the purposes of this policy. B. USE OF A SERVICE ANIMAL ON SCHOOL PROPERTY BY STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES 1. Introduction of a Service Animal School administrators shall facilitate the introduction of an eligible service animal into the school environment. To promote a successful integration of the service animal into the educational program and to minimize unnecessary disruption, an employee or student with a disability who intends to bring a service animal to school during the school day is encouraged to follow these guidelines. a. The employee, student, or student\u2019s parent should notify the superintendent and the principal of the applicable school in writing at least 10 work days prior to the date proposed to bring the service animal onto school property. b. The employee, student, or student\u2019s parent should work with school personnel to create a plan addressing the presence of the service animal during the school day. A plan to integrate a service Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7321R Page 1 of 4 animal into the school environment should include the following: 1) appropriate training for school personnel and students regarding interaction with the service animal; 2) arrangements for meeting the service animal\u2019s basic needs during the school day; 3) any necessary modifications to the educational program so that the employee or student with a disability may be accompanied by the service animal; and 4) when necessary, provisions for the presence of a handler other than the employee or student with the disability to control or care for the service animal. c. It is recommended, but not required, that the service animal wear identification to provide adequate notice to students, school personnel, and school visitors that the dog is a service animal. d. The service animal should be free of parasites and otherwise in good health. 2. Presence of a Service Animal on School Property An employee or student with a disability accompanied by a service animal must meet the following requirements for a service animal to be present on school property. a. A student or employee who elects to be accompanied by a service animal will be expected to care for and supervise the animal. If a student is not capable of providing adequate care and supervision, the parent will be responsible for providing such care and supervision. b. If a student requires assistance from a parent or handler to control and care for the service animal while on school property, that individual must submit to a background screening, which may include a criminal history check in accordance with state law and any procedures established by the superintendent. c. The service animal must be on a leash or other mechanical restraint at all times. If mechanical restraint is not feasible due to a student\u2019s disability, the animal must be under other sufficient means of control. d. The service animal must be housebroken, under the control of its handler, and have received all necessary vaccinations as required by state law. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7321R Page 2 of 4 The principal or designee shall notify all security personnel of the existence and possible locations of any service animals on school property. C. USE OF A SERVICE ANIMAL ON SCHOOL PROPERTY BY SCHOOL VISITORS A school visitor who is an individual with a disability may be accompanied by a service animal in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations and with policy 5020, Visitors to the Schools. A service animal that is accompanying a school visitor may be properly excluded from school property for a reason(s) set forth in section E of this policy. D. LIABILITY The board may hold the owner or handler of a service animal liable for any property damage caused by the animal to the same extent required by other board policy or administrative rules that impose liability for property damage. In addition, either the owner or handler, or both, may be liable for personal injury caused by the animal or related to the presence of the animal on school property. E. EXCLUSION OF A SERVICE ANIMAL FROM SCHOOL PROPERTY School personnel shall not ask an individual with a disability about the nature or extent of his or her disability or for proof of a service animal\u2019s training as a condition of allowing the animal onto school property. However, when not readily apparent to school personnel, a principal or designee may inquire as to whether the animal is required because of a disability and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform. Such inquiries may be made to confirm that the dog is a service animal and is rightfully present on school property. A principal or designee may exclude a service animal from school property for the following reasons: 1. The animal poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable modifications. 2. The animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it. 3. The animal is not housebroken. 4. The presence or behavior of the animal fundamentally alters the service, program, or activity of the school system. If a principal or designee excludes a dog or service animal from school property, the principal or designee must document the reasons for the exclusion and notify the superintendent. The superintendent or designee will make a determination on whether a service animal will be allowed to return to the school and, if reasonably Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7321R Page 3 of 4 possible, notify the individual with the disability in writing of the decision within five work days of the initial exclusion. If the superintendent determines that an animal does not meet the definition of a service animal or that a service animal should be excluded for one or more of the reasons described in this section, the student\u2019s Section 504 or IEP Team shall meet to consider and document whether the animal\u2019s presence is necessary for the child to receive an appropriate education or to have equal access to the educational program and, if not, whether the child needs other aids and services or accommodations. If a service animal is excluded, an individual with a disability will be provided the opportunity to participate in educational services, programs or activities as required by law without having the service animal on the premises. F. APPEAL OF AN EXCLUSION OF A SERVICE ANIMAL FROM SCHOOL PROPERTY The superintendent\u2019s decision regarding exclusion of a service animal from school property in accordance with this policy may be appealed consistent with policy 1720/4015/7225, Discrimination, Harassment, and Bullying Complaint Procedure, and any other procedure established by the superintendent under policy 1730/4022/7231, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disabilities.

It further recognizes the importance of employees, students, and parents engaging, learning, collaborating, and sharing in digital environments as part of 21st Century learning. The Board strives to ensure that electronic communication tools incorporated into the school curriculum are used responsibly and safely. As practicable, the Board will provide access to secure social media tools and Board approved technologies for use during instructional time and for school-sponsored activities in accordance with policies 3220, Technology in the Educational Program, and 3225/4312/7320, Technology Responsible Use. The Board acknowledges that school employees may engage in the use of social media during their personal time. School employees who use social media for personal purposes must be mindful that they are responsible for their public conduct even when not acting in their capacities as school system employees. All school employees, including student teachers and independent contractors shall comply with the requirements of this policy when using electronic social media for personal purposes. For the purposes of this policy, \u201csocial media\u201d includes, but is not limited to: personal websites, web logs (blogs), wikis, social network sites, online forums, virtual worlds, video-sharing websites, and any other social media generally available to the public or consumers that does not fall within the Board\u2019s technologies network (e.g., Web 2.0 tools, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Flickr, YouTube). In addition, this policy applies to any form of instant or direct messaging available through social media. Other forms of one-to-one electronic communications with students including voice, email and text-messaging are subject to the terms of policy 4040, Staff-Student Relations. A. SOCIAL MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS INVOLVING STUDENTS Employees are to maintain professional relationships with students at all times in accordance with policies 4040/7310, Staff-Student Relations, and 7300, Staff Responsibilities. All electronic communications with students who are currently enrolled in the school system must be school-related and within the scope of the employees\u2019 professional responsibilities, unless otherwise authorized by this policy. School personnel may use only school-controlled technological resources and social media tools to communicate directly with students or to comment on student matters through use of the Internet. An employee seeking to utilize and/or establish a non-school-controlled social media website for instructional or other school-related purposes must have prior written approval from the Superintendent or designee and principal and meet any applicable requirements of policies 3220, Technology in the Educational Program, 3225/4312/7320, Technology Responsible Use, and 3227/7322, Web Page Development. The use of electronic media for communicating with students and parents is an extension of the employee\u2019s workplace responsibilities. Accordingly, the Board expects employees {CS: 00027467.DOC} BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 1 of 4 Policy Code: 7335 to use professional judgment when using social media or other electronic communications. Employees are prohibited from knowingly communicating with current students through a personal social network page. An Internet posting on a personal social media website intended for a particular student will be considered a form of direct communication with that student in violation of this policy. However, an employee may communicate with a student using personal social media networks to the extent the employee and student have a family relationship or other type of appropriate relationship which originated outside of the school setting. For example, an employee may have a relationship with a niece or nephew, a student who is the child of an adult friend, a student who is a friend of the employee\u2019s child, or a member or participant in the same civic, social, recreational, sport or religious organization. Employees are responsible for appropriate content in communicating with students. B. EMPLOYEE PERSONAL USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA The Board respects the right of employees to use social media as a medium of self- expression on their personal time. As role models for the school system\u2019s students, however, employees are responsible for their public conduct even when they are not performing their job duties as employees of the school system. Employees will be held to the same professional standards in their public use of social media and other electronic communications as they are for any other public conduct. Further, school employees remain subject to applicable state and federal laws, Board policies, administrative regulations, and the Code of Ethics for North Carolina Educators, even if communicating with others concerning personal and private matters. If an employee\u2019s use of social media interferes with the employee\u2019s ability to effectively perform his or her job duties, the employee is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Employees are responsible for the content on their social media sites, including content added by the employee, the employee\u2019s friends, or members of the public who can access the employee\u2019s site, and for Web links on the employee\u2019s site. Employees shall take reasonable precautions, such as using available security settings, to restrict students from viewing their personal information on social media websites and to prevent students from accessing materials that are not age-appropriate. School employees are prohibited from accessing social networking websites for personal use during working hours. C. POSTING TO SOCIAL MEDIA SITES Employees who use social media for personal purposes must be aware that the content they post may be viewed by anyone, including students, parents, and community members. Employees shall observe the following principles when communicating through social media: {CS: 00027467.DOC} BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 2 of 4 Policy Code: 7335 1. Employees shall not post confidential information about students, employees, or school system business. 2. Employees shall not accept current students as \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cfollowers\u201d or otherwise connect with students on social media sites, unless the employee and student have a family relationship or other type of appropriate relationship which originated outside of the school setting. 3. Employees shall not knowingly allow students access to their personal social media sites that discuss or portray sex, nudity, alcohol, or drug use or other behaviors associated with the employees\u2019 private lives that would be inappropriate to discuss with a student at school. 4. Employees may not knowingly grant students access to any portions of their personal social media sites that are not accessible to the general public, unless the employee and student have a family relationship or other type of appropriate relationship which originated outside of the school setting. 5. Employees shall be professional in all Internet postings related to or referencing the school system, students, and other employees. 6. Employees shall not use profane, pornographic, obscene, indecent, lewd, vulgar, or sexually offensive language, pictures or graphics or other communication that could reasonably be anticipated to cause a substantial disruption to the school environment. 7. Employees shall not use the school system\u2019s logo or other copyrighted material of the system without express, written consent from the Board. 8. Employees shall not post identifiable images of a student or student\u2019s family without permission from the student and the student\u2019s parent or legal guardian. 9. Employees shall not use Internet postings to libel or defame the Board, individual Board members, students, or other school employees. 10. Employees shall not use Internet postings to harass, bully, or intimidate other employees or students in violation of policy 1710/4021/7230, Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Bullying, or state and federal laws. 11. Employees shall not post inappropriate content that negatively impacts their ability to perform their jobs. 12. Employees shall not use Internet postings to engage in any other conduct that violates Board policy and administrative procedures or state and federal laws. {CS: 00027467.DOC} BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 3 of 4 Policy Code: 7335 D. CONSEQUENCES School system personnel shall monitor online activities of employees who access the Internet using school technological resources. Additionally, the Superintendent or designee may periodically conduct public Internet searches to determine if an employee has engaged in conduct that violates this policy. Any employee who has been found by the Superintendent to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. The Superintendent shall establish and communicate to employees guidelines that are consistent with this policy. Legal References: U.S. Const. amend.

Furthermore, creating an exemplary professional model for students is desirable. In keeping with this understanding, every employee of Avery County Schools will be requested to maintain a level of personal hygiene necessary to ensure an appropriate educational environment and to refrain from any mode of dress that is not professional. Every employee is encouraged to observe a standard of grooming and dress consistent with the level of formality of the school situation.

Generally, in order to carry out the responsibilities of the school system, teachers and other staff members may also be required to perform certain non-instructional and extracurricular duties. Assigned additional duties are considered part of all employees\u2019 responsibilities. However, assignment of additional duties to teachers should be minimized to allow time for teachers to plan, collaborate with colleagues, conference with parents, tutor students and perform any other activities that have a direct impact on student achievement. Beginning teachers also need adequate opportunities to develop their professional skills and need access to experienced teachers who can mentor them. In light of these goals, the principal of each school has the authority to assign extracurricular and non-instructional duties as necessary to conduct the business of the school, within the following guidelines. A. EXTRACURRICULAR DUTIES Initially licensed teachers may not be assigned extracurricular duties unless they request the assignments in writing. 1. Extracurricular Duties Defined Extracurricular duties include those duties performed by a teacher outside the regular school day that involve students and are not directly related to the instructional program. Examples of extracurricular activities for which consent is required include such things as coaching duties, taking tickets at sporting events, or acting as a faculty sponsor for a student club. Extracurricular duties do not include such things as time spent in parent- teacher conferences or activities related to courses taught by the teacher, such as band concerts that are performed as a part of band class. 2. Exceptions Permitted for Compelling Reasons In cases of compelling need, initially licensed teachers may be required to perform extracurricular duties if the procedures set forth in this paragraph are followed. a. Compelling Need Defined A compelling need arises when the principal of a school is not reasonably able to provide adequate supervision by qualified personnel at extracurricular activities without using initially licensed teachers and no initially licensed teachers have Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3622/7405 Page 1 of 4 volunteered in writing to perform these activities. In determining whether a compelling need exists, it will be assumed that teaching assistants and other non-certified employees may not be assigned to extracurricular duties unless the assignment is approved in advance by the superintendent or designee. Examples of compelling need include circumstances when: (1) an employee who is scheduled to perform an extracurricular duty is unexpectedly unavailable and the position must be filled quickly; (2) the school principal cannot adequately fill extracurricular duty positions without additional reliance on initially licensed teachers; or (3) an extracurricular duty must be supervised by individuals with certain experience, skills, or qualifications and initially licensed teachers are the only qualified staff members who possess the required experience, skills or qualifications. b. Process for Granting a Compelling Need Waiver (1) Board Waiver In cases where the need for a waiver is reasonably foreseeable and there is an opportunity to bring the matter before the board of education for approval prior to the extra duty, the superintendent shall bring the matter to the board for a decision on the waiver request. The recommendation for a waiver must be in writing and set forth the circumstances requiring the waiver. The board minutes or other documentation shall reflect the reasons for granting the waiver. (2) Superintendent Waiver If there is not a scheduled board meeting prior to the need to staff the extracurricular activity, the superintendent may waive the requirement upon a finding of compelling need. The superintendent shall make a written record of all such waivers and the circumstances for requesting each waiver. At the next regular board meeting, the superintendent shall report to the board any past waivers made and the reasons therefore. If the waiver is for an ongoing activity, the superintendent must seek and obtain board approval to continue the initially licensed teacher in the extracurricular activity in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (1), Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3622/7405 Page 2 of 4 above. (3) Principal Waiver If there is an exigent need to waive the policy, such as the unexpected illness or absence of an employee, then the school principal is authorized to waive the policy temporarily for up to five days. However, the principal must report the waiver to the superintendent in writing, setting forth the circumstances requiring the waiver. The superintendent must approve all waivers over five days, as provided in paragraph (2), above. The board must approve all continuing waivers at its next regular meeting, as provided in paragraph (1) above. (4) Teacher Access to Records The teacher may request and is entitled to receive any documentation regarding waivers requested or granted under this policy. B. NON-INSTRUCTIONAL DUTIES Principals shall minimize the assignment of non-instructional duties to all teachers, including initially licensed teachers. Specifically, teachers should not be required to use their daily planning periods on an ongoing and regular basis to supervise students. Planning periods generally should be reserved for course planning and meetings with other professional staff regarding the instructional program. 1. Non-instructional Duties Defined Non-instructional duties refer to those duties that are not directly involved with the instructional program or the implementation of the current statewide instructional standards, but that all teachers are expected to do. This includes such things as bus duty, carpool duty, and regular and ongoing use of planning periods to monitor hallways and cafeterias. Nothing in this policy should be construed to relieve teachers of the responsibility to provide for the safety and supervision of students during regular school hours, as necessary to maintain order and discipline in the school. 2. Distribution of Non-Instructional Duties Non-instructional duties should be distributed equitably among employees to the extent it is reasonably possible to do so. In assigning non- instructional duties, consideration should be given to the need for initially licensed teachers to have adequate professional development, planning Avery County Schools Policy Code: 3622/7405 Page 3 of 4 time and access to more experienced teachers. Principals are responsible for structuring such opportunities in such a way that will be beneficial to the students and employees at their schools. C. EVALUATION The failure of an initially licensed teacher to volunteer to perform extracurricular duties is not appropriate grounds to lower the teacher\u2019s evaluation or just cause for less than proficient evaluation rating of an initially licensed teacher, provided that the teacher has conducted himself/herself in a professional manner when declining to accept extracurricular duties. However, a teacher\u2019s failure to perform an assigned non-instructional or extracurricular duty in a competent and professional manner may be considered as a part of the teacher\u2019s evaluation.

All teacher employment contracts entered into by the board will meet the requirements of state law and State Board of Education policy. Nothing in this policy is intended to grant or confer any employment rights beyond those existing in law. For the purposes of this policy, the term \u201cteacher\u201d is defined as a person who meets the requirements of G.S. 115C-325.1(6). An individual who is employed under a part-time teacher contract does not meet this definition of teacher; however, the board\u2019s performance expectations established in this policy apply to such individuals. A. TEACHER PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS Teachers are responsible for facilitating student learning in a safe and orderly environment in which students become college and career ready. Teachers must be familiar with the current statewide instructional standards for their teaching assignment and able to teach the curriculum effectively. The board expects teachers to meet all performance standards established by the board, the superintendent or designee, state law, and State Board of Education policy, and to pursue professional development as provided in policy 1610/7800, Professional and Staff Development. Employment contracts for teaching will be granted or renewed only for individuals of proven ability who strive for excellence. B. SUPERINTENDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION The board will employ teachers upon the recommendation of the superintendent. The superintendent is expected to be able to substantiate with supporting information any recommendation for a new or renewed contract for an applicant or current teacher. The superintendent\u2019s recommendation for a new or renewed contract must include the length of the term of the contract, which must be consistent with state law and board requirements as described in Section C, below. The board will follow a recommendation of the superintendent regarding the length of the contract that is consistent with law and this policy unless specific circumstances justify offering the teacher a contract of a different term. In considering the superintendent\u2019s recommendation, the board may review any information that was in the teacher\u2019s personnel file at the time of the superintendent\u2019s recommendation or was added to the teacher\u2019s file, with the proper notice to the teacher, prior to the board\u2019s decision. C. DETERMINATION OF CONTRACT LENGTH This section applies when the superintendent has decided to recommend that the board offer a teacher a new or renewed contract. For information regarding a decision by the superintendent not to recommend that the board offer a teacher a renewed contract, see policy 7950, Non-Career Status Teachers: Nonrenewal. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7410 Page 1 of 3 To be recommended for a four-year contract, a teacher must: 1. have been employed by the board as a teacher for at least three years and be in good standing; 2. have received a rating of at least \u201cproficient\u201d on all standards on the two most recent annual evaluations; 3. not currently be on a monitored or directed growth plan, mandatory improvement plan, or corrective action plan and not have been on any such plan at any time during the current or previous school year; 4. not have received any of the following during the current or previous school year: a demotion, a suspension without pay, or a written reprimand, or other disciplinary action that is documented in the teacher\u2019s official personnel file; 5. not have other relevant performance or conduct information in his or her personnel file that would support a decision to disqualify the teacher from a multi-year contract. If renewed, a contract for a teacher who is not in good standing may be for a term of one year only. D. DISMISSAL AND NONRENEWAL This policy is not intended to limit the superintendent\u2019s discretion to recommend dismissal, demotion, a shorter contract length, or nonrenewal of any teacher for any basis allowed by law, including, but not limited to, reduction in force due to school system reorganization, decreased enrollment, reduced funding, or other budgetary issues as described in board policy 7920, reduction in Force: Teachers and School Administrators. Any employee who does not meet the performance or other standards of the board, the standards of state law or the State Board of Education, or the terms of the employment contract may be subject to demotion or dismissal, as provided in policy 7930, Professional Employees: Demotion and Dismissal, or to nonrenewal, as provided in policy 7950, Non- Career Status Teachers: Nonrenewal.

The board further believes that students will not excel in performance unless those who most directly affect students, including school administrators, teachers and other licensed professionals, excel in their performance. For the purposes of this policy, the term \u201cschool administrator\u201d is defined as a principal, assistant principal, supervisor, or director whose major function includes the supervision of teaching or any other part of the instructional program. School administrator contracts will be granted, extended or renewed only for individuals of proven ability who strive for excellence. School administrators should be able to demonstrate student learning, effectiveness in carrying out the responsibility of providing for school safety, and enforcing student discipline. The superintendent is expected to be able to substantiate any recommendation for granting a new contract, extending a current contract or renewing a contract with evaluation data, as described in board policy 7815 Evaluation of Licensed Employees, or with regard to applicants, with data from the selection process as provided in board policy 7100 Recruitment and Selection of Personnel. If the board is not satisfied that an applicant or employee has met the standards established by the board, employment will be denied, following statutorily prescribed procedures. Initial contracts between a school administrator and the board will be for a term of two to four years. Four-year initial contracts will be granted only to exemplary school administrators. Absent unusual circumstances, two-year initial contracts will be granted for individuals who do not have experience as school administrators. In addition, one- year contracts may be granted to individuals who hold a provisional assistant principal\u2019s license. Subsequent contracts between a principal or assistant principal and the board will be granted for a term of four years. An employee who has a school administrator contract with the school district is expected to continue to strive for excellence, meet all performance standards established by the board, and pursue professional development as provided in board policy 1610/7800 Professional and Staff Development. Any employee who is unable or unwilling to meet reasonable standards of the board may be subject to demotion or dismissal, as provided in board policy 7930 and in accordance with statutorily prescribed procedures. Decisions of the superintendent and board with regard to recommendations and offers and decisions not to recommend or offer new, renewed, or extended contracts will be made in accordance with G.S. 115C-287.1. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7425 Page 1 of 2 If the superintendent decides not to recommend that the board offer a school administrator a new, renewed or extended contract, the employee has all procedural rights accorded by G.S. 115C-287.1. In considering a recommendation of the superintendent to offer a school administrator a new, renewed, or extended contract, the board may review any information that was in the employee\u2019s personnel file at the time of the superintendent\u2019s recommendation. If the board determines that it needs additional information to reach a decision, it will notify the administrator of the board\u2019s concerns and of the additional information that it is considering and provide an opportunity for the employee to respond to the additional information.

In keeping with NC GS 115-C 47(4), NC State Board of Education policy SS-D-002, the NCHSAA guidelines, and local Avery County Schools Board policies, the head coach of an interscholastic athletic team shall be a bona fide member of the faculty and as such shall be responsible for the supervision of athletic teams during all practices, games, and trips. Local boards of education may designate as a head coach any person employed by and paid by the board as an instructional staff member. In cases of emergency, local superintendents may employ non-faculty persons as head coaches for varsity or junior varsity teams. This is with the concurrence of the local board of education and until such times as a suitable bona fide faculty member becomes available to serve as head coach. Individuals authorized to coach in this manner are required to know and follow the rules of the NCHSAA and SDPI, including the sports season regulation. Assistant coaches will be recommended in the same manner as head coaches. The board and superintendent may take into consideration recommendations from the principal for final approval for all coaching positions. Individuals who volunteer or are employed to coach in the Avery County School System should be loyal to the Avery County and are encouraged to coach only in Avery County Schools.

WORK SCHEDULES The length of the school day for licensed and professional staff will be a minimum of seven hours and thirty minutes and will continue until professional responsibilities to the student and school are completed. Administrative meetings, curriculum development, pupil supervision, assigned duties, parent conferences, group or individual planning and extra-curricular activities may require hours beyond the stated minimum. Work schedules for other employees will be defined by the superintendent or designee, consistent with the Fair Labor Standards Act and the provisions of this policy. B. WORKWEEK DEFINED Working hours for all employees not exempted under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) will conform to federal and state regulations. The superintendent shall ensure that job positions are classified as exempt or non-exempt and that employees are made aware of such classifications. Supervisors shall make every effort to avoid circumstances which require non-exempt employees to work more than 40 hours each week. For purposes of Fair Labor Standards Act Compliance, the workweek for school system employees will be 12:00 a.m. Sunday until 11:59 p.m. Saturday. A copy of the Fair Labor Standards Act and any administrative procedures established by the superintendent will be available to employees in the human resources office. C. OVERTIME AND COMPENSATORY TIME The board of education discourages overtime work by non-exempt employees. A non- exempt employee may not work overtime without the express approval of his or her supervisor. All overtime work must be approved by the superintendent or designee. All supervisory personnel shall monitor overtime use on a weekly basis and report such use to the superintendent or designee. Principals and supervisors shall monitor employees\u2019 work, shall ensure that overtime provisions of the policy and the FLSA are followed, and shall ensure that all employees are compensated for any overtime worked. Principals or supervisors may need to adjust daily schedules to prevent non-exempt employees from working more than 40 hours in a workweek. Accurate and complete timesheets of actual hours worked during the workweek must be signed by each employee and submitted to the finance officer. The finance officer shall review work records of employees on a regular basis to make an assessment of overtime use. In lieu of overtime compensation, non-exempt employees may receive compensatory time off at a rate of not less than one and one-half hours for each one hour of overtime worked, if such compensatory time (1) is agreed to by the employee before the overtime work is performed and (2) is authorized by the immediate supervisor. Employees must be allowed to use compensatory time within a reasonable period after requesting such use (see policy 7510, Leave). Employees may accrue a maximum of 240 compensatory time Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7500 Page 1 of 3 hours before they must be provided overtime pay at the appropriate rate. In addition, upon leaving the school system, an employee must be paid for any unused compensatory time at the rate of not less than the higher of (1) the average rate received by the employee during his or her last three years of employment or (2) the final regular rate received by the employee. Non-exempt employees whose workweek is less than 40 hours will be paid at the regular rate of pay for time worked up to 40 hours. Such employees will be provided overtime pay or compensatory time as provided above for working more than 40 hours in a workweek. Employees will be provided a copy of this policy and will be required to sign this policy to acknowledge their understanding of overtime and compensatory time provisions. Such signed policy will constitute the agreement required in this section. D. ATTENDANCE EXPECTATIONS All employees are expected to be present during all working hours. Absence without prior approval, chronic absences, habitual tardiness or abuses of designated working hours are all considered neglect of duty and will result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.

All employees will use a standard time sheet devised for Avery County Schools to continue meeting FLSA requirements. 2. All employees will sign in every day they are at work, when their workday begins, as determined by the supervisor. Employees will sign out when leaving their worksite for any personal, non-work related purpose and sign back in when returning to the worksite. Employees will sign out at the end of their workday, as determined by their supervisor. 3. Employees shall not sign another person in or out, unless they are the employee\u2019s supervisor. Employees shall not ask another employee to sign them in or out unless the employee asked is their supervisor. This will be a falsification of a legal document resulting in disciplinary actions, possibly including dismissal for all parties involved. 4. Any changes to a work schedule must be pre-approved by the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor. Supervisors may need to adjust daily schedules to prevent non-exempt employees from working more than 40 hours in a workweek. 5. Non-exempt employees whose workweek is less than 40 hours will be paid at the regular rate of pay for time worked up to 40 hours. Such employees will be provided compensatory time for working more than 40 hours in a workweek. 6. Employees shall have prior written approval to work overtime. Adopted: 8/04/03 Revised: 2/22/18 Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7500 Page 3 of 3","title":"7500   Workday and Overtime"},{"location":"Policies/7000 Series/7510 - Leave/","text":"Avery County Schools Policy Policy Code: 7510 LEAVE OF ABSENCE The Avery County Board of Education believes that it is important for employees to have leave available to attend to personal, civic and professional matters as well as to meet family commitments. This need for leave is to be balanced with the need to provide an effective instructional program for students. No employee will be discharged, demoted or otherwise subjected to adverse employment action for taking leave in accordance with board policies and administrative procedures. All requests for leave, with or without pay, will be addressed in accordance with state and federal law, as well as policies promulgated by the State Board of Education, including those specified in the most current edition of the North Carolina Public Schools Benefits and Employment Policy Manual, available at http://www.ncpublicschools.org/district-humanresources/key-information. In addition to applicable laws and regulations, this board policy applies to leave requests. The information in this policy is intended to supplement, not replace, the requirements of law and the State Board of Education. In the event that changes to State or federal law or regulation conflict with current State Board or local board policies, the board intends that its leave practices be modified to the extent necessary to comply with current law until such time as conforming changes to State Board and/or local board are made. The superintendent shall develop any necessary administrative procedures and make them available to employees upon request. A. MINIMUM LEAVE TIME An employee may take any type of leave in increments of hours unless otherwise specified in this policy. B. CONTINUOUS LEAVE OF MORE THAN TEN DAYS An employee must comply with the notice and verification requirements as provided in policy 7520, Family Medical Leave, for any continuous leave of more than 10 days if: (1) the leave also is eligible for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), defined in policy 7520 Family Medical Leave, and (2) the leave is designated as FMLA-eligible at the time leave is taken or as soon as feasible thereafter. See policy 7520, Family and Medical Leave. C. SICK LEAVE The superintendent or designee may require a statement from a medical doctor or other acceptable proof that the employee was unable to work due to illness or injury. Employees who anticipate using sick leave should inform their immediate supervisor in advance so that arrangements may be made to reassign the employee's duties during the period of absence. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7510 Page 1 of 3 D. PERSONAL LEAVE Personal leave must be used in half or whole day units. Personal leave may be used only upon the authorization of the teacher\u2019s immediate supervisor and in accordance with legal requirement and procedures established by the superintendent. E. VACATION LEAVE Vacation may be taken only upon the authorization of the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor and in accordance with legal requirements and procedures established by the superintendent. To promote the efficient operation of the schools, the superintendent may designate certain periods during the nonacademic year as preferred vacation periods for twelve-month employees. F. COMPENSATORY LEAVE Because professional employees are expected to fulfill all job duties, compensatory leave should only apply in extraordinary circumstances. Employees who are not exempt from the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act may accrue compensatory time (comp time) at a rate of 1.5 hours for every 1 hour worked in lieu of receiving overtime pay for hours worked beyond 40 in a given workweek. For purposes of Fair Labor Standards Act compliance, the workweek for school district employees will be 12:00 a.m. Sunday until 11:59 p.m. Saturday. Supervisors will arrange for employees to take comp time within one pay period following the time it is earned if possible. The superintendent or designee may exempt certain employees or categories of employees from this comp time provision when deemed necessary for the proper administration of the school district. All employees must obtain approval from their immediate supervisors before taking compensatory leave. G. LEAVE TO TEACH AT A CHARTER, REGIONAL, OR LAB SCHOOL Leave of absence to teach for one year at a charter, regional, or lab school will be granted to a teacher upon timely request to the board. The request must be provided at least 45 days before the teacher would otherwise have to report for duty if it is the initial year of the charter/regional/lab school\u2019s operation and at least 90 days if it is after the charter/regional/lab school\u2019s initial year of operation. The teacher may return to work in the school system in accordance with the provisions of applicable state law. H. DISCRETIONARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY An employee, who wishes to take leave that is not eligible for any other specific type of leave, may be granted a leave of absence without pay for a period of up to one calendar year at the discretion of the superintendent with approval from the board. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7510 Page 2 of 3 The employee is expected first to consult with his or her immediate supervisor and then to provide advance written notice (60 days if possible) stating the beginning and ending dates of the desired leave of absence. The superintendent may request documentation from the employee in support of his or her request. In determining the length of the leave of absence without pay that will be approved, due and proper consideration must be given to the welfare of students as well as the employee. The superintendent may require the employee to give notice of his or her intent to return to work at reasonable time intervals during the leave. Once a leave of absence without pay has been requested and approved by the board of education, the dates are binding unless both parties agree to a change. I. OTHER LEAVE Other types of leave, such as leave for observance of a bona fide religious holiday, professional leave, community responsibility leave, leave for jury duty or court attendance, elected officials leave, parental involvement in schools leave, parental leave without pay, and military leave (see policy 7530, Military Leave), will be granted in accordance with the requirements of law and State Board of Education policy.

The FMLA allows eligible employees to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks (or 26 workweeks in certain cases) in any 12-month period for certain qualifying conditions or events. The employee may continue to participate in the school system\u2019s group insurance plan while on FMLA leave. This policy is intended for guidance only and is not intended to alter or expand the school system\u2019s responsibilities beyond the requirements of law. If any provision of this policy is inconsistent with federal law or regulation, the federal rule must take precedence. The superintendent is authorized to develop additional regulations for FMLA leave consistent with the requirements of the law and this policy. Employees can find more information about FMLA leave in the North Carolina Public Schools Benefits and Employment Policy Manual. The board strictly prohibits interfering with, restraining or denying the ability of any employee to exercise any right provided by the FMLA. The board also strictly prohibits any type of discrimination against or discharge of an employee who has filed a complaint in regard to the FMLA. A copy of this policy will be provided to each employee upon hiring. A. DEFINITIONS 1. Serious Health Condition A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves either an overnight stay in a medical care facility or continuing treatment by a health care provider for a condition that either prevents the employee from performing the functions of the employee\u2019s job or prevents the qualified family member from participating in school or other daily activities. 2. Continuing Treatment Subject to certain conditions, the continuing treatment requirement in the above definition of \u201cserious health condition\u201d may be met by a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days combined with at least two visits to a health care provider or one visit and a regimen of continuing treatment or incapacity due to pregnancy or a chronic condition. Other conditions may meet the definition of continuing treatment. 3. Other Terms Unless otherwise noted, all terms in this policy must be defined in accordance with 29 C.F.R. pt. 825. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520 Page 1 of 9 B. ELIGIBILITY Generally, employees are eligible for unpaid FMLA leave if they have: 1. been employed by the school system for at least 12 months (but not necessarily consecutively); and 2. worked at least 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months. Further information about these requirements can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 29 C.F.R. 825.110. C. QUALIFYING CONDITIONS Except in cases of leave to care for a covered service member with a serious illness or injury, an eligible employee is entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of FMLA leave during any 12-month period for any one or more of the following reasons: 1. the birth and first-year care of the employee\u2019s child; 2. adoption or foster placement of a child with the employee; 3. a serious health condition of the employee or the employee\u2019s spouse, child or parent; 4. a qualifying exigency (see Section F) arising out of the fact that the spouse or a son, daughter or parent of the employee has been deployed, or is on notice of an impending deployment to a foreign country as a member of the regular Armed Forces on active duty or as a member of the Reserves components of the Armed Forces under a federal call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation; or 5. to care for a covered service member with a serious illness or injury (\u201ccovered service member\u201d and \u201cserious injury or illness\u201d are defined in federal regulation 29 C.F.R. 825.127). An employee who is a spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of the service member may take leave for a period of up to 24 workweeks under this provision. D. DETERMINING THE 12-MONTH LEAVE PERIOD The 12-month period during which an employee is eligible for FMLA leave will be from July 1 to June 30. Exception: The period for leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness begins on the first day the employee takes leave for this reason and ends 12 months later. E. ENTITLEMENT TO LEAVE Eligible employees may take leave as follows: 1. Medical leave for serious health conditions: A combined total of 12 workweeks during a 12-month period. The leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule as is medically necessary. 2. Family leave for pregnancy, birth of a child or placement of a child for foster care or adoption: A combined total of 12 consecutive workweeks during a 12- Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520 Page 2 of 9 month period. Eligibility for FMLA leave expires 12 months from the birth, foster care placement or adoption of the child. Leave must be used in a single block of time unless the board agrees to another arrangement. 3. Military service exigency: A combined total of 12 workweeks during a 12- month period. The leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. 4. Leave to care for injured service member: A combined total of no more than 26 workweeks during a single 12-month period. The leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. If combined with other types of FMLA leave, the total leave taken in a single 12-month period still may not exceed 26 weeks. 5. Spouses employed by the school system: Spouses who are both employed by the school system and eligible for FMLA leave are limited in the amount of family leave they may take for the birth and care of a newborn child, for the placement of a child for adoption or foster care or to care for a parent who has a serious health condition to a combined total of 12 weeks (or 26 weeks if leave to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness is also used). F. QUALIFIED MILITARY SERVICE EXIGENCIES A military service exigency that qualifies for FMLA leave must be defined in accordance with federal regulations. Qualified exigencies may include: 1. short notice deployment; 2. military events and related activities; 3. school and childcare activities; 4. financial and legal arrangements; 5. counseling; 6. rest and recuperation leave; 7. post-deployment activities; 8. parental care; and 9. additional activities agreed upon by the board and employee. G. INTERMITTENT OR REDUCED WORK SCHEDULE 1. An employee may take FMLA on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule as required for the health of the employee or family member, due to a qualifying exigency, or as otherwise approved by the superintendent. The employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the school. Whenever possible, employees should discuss scheduling with his or her immediate supervisor prior to scheduling any medical treatment in order to accommodate the work schedule. 2. An employee requesting intermittent or reduced leave time for medical treatment of a serious health condition may be required to give the reasons for the intermittent or reduced leave schedule and the schedule for treatment. 3. To better accommodate an employee's need for intermittent or reduced leave for a serious health condition, the school system may require an employee to take an Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520 Page 3 of 9 alternative position during the period of leave. The alternative position must have equal pay and benefits, but it does not have to have equivalent duties. 4. Employees may take intermittent leave in increments of one hour. 5. Instructional personnel are subject to special rules for taking intermittent or reduced leave. (See section H.) H. INSTRUCTIONAL PERSONNEL The following special rules apply to instructional personnel only. For purposes of this policy, instructional personnel are teachers, athletic coaches, driving instructors, special education assistants and any other employee whose principal function is to teach and instruct students. 1. Use of Intermittent or Reduced Schedule Leave a) Instructional employees may use intermittent or reduced schedule leave only when the employee and the school system have reached an agreement on how the leave will be used. b) If an instructional employee requests intermittent or reduced schedule leave for more than 20 percent of the working days of the duration of a leave due to medical treatment, the school system may require the employee to take continuous leave for up to the entire duration of the scheduled leave or to transfer to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits for the period of leave. c) Instructional employees taking intermittent or reduced schedule leave that constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during the leave period are not subject to transfer to an alternative position. 2. Extension of FMLA Leave at School System Discretion The school system may require instructional personnel to continue leave through the end of the school semester if any of the following conditions exist: a) the leave will begin more than five weeks before the end of the term; the leave will last at least three weeks; and the employee would return to work in the last three weeks of the academic term; b) the leave is for a purpose other than the employee's own serious health condition or for a military exigency; the leave will begin in the last five weeks of the term; the leave will last more than two weeks; and the employee would return to work during the last two weeks of the academic term; or c) the leave is for a purpose other than the employee's own serious health condition or for a military exigency; the leave will begin in the last three weeks of the term; and the leave will last at least five days. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520 Page 4 of 9 If the school system requires an instructional employee to take leave until the end of the academic term, only the period of leave until the employee is ready and able to return to work will be charged against the employee's FMLA entitlement. I. EMPLOYEE'S RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN REQUESTING LEAVE To ensure that employees receive proper notification of their rights and responsibilities and that leave is properly designated, all employees requesting any type of leave must make the request to the director of human resources or designee. 1. Employee's Responsibility When Leave is Foreseeable a) The employee must provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. If this amount of notice is not possible, then notice must be given as soon as practicable, taking into account all of the facts and circumstances. b) Employees must provide sufficient information for the school system reasonably to determine (1) whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request and (2) the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. This information would include, for example, notice that the employee is unable to perform job functions, notice that the family member is unable to perform daily activities, notice of the need for hospitalization or continuing treatment by a health care provider or notice of circumstances supporting the need for military family leave. c) If the employee does not provide 30 days' notice and there is no reasonable justification for the delay, the school system may delay the FMLA leave until at least 30 days after the employee provides notice of the need for FMLA leave. d) If an instructional employee fails to give the required notice of foreseeable leave for an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, the school system may require the employee to take continuous leave for the duration of his or her treatment or may temporarily transfer the employee to an alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that has the same benefits. (See section H.) 2. Employee\u2019s Responsibilities When Leave is Not Foreseeable a) When leave is not foreseeable, employees must comply with the usual school system procedures for notifying their supervisors of the absence and requesting leave, including any applicable requirements established in policy 7510, Leave of Absence. If the employee fails to do so, the leave may be delayed or denied. b) When giving notice of absence, the employee must inform the supervisor if the requested leave is for a reason for which FMLA leave was previously taken or certified. c) Employees also must notify the director of human resources or designee of the need for FMLA leave as soon as practicable. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520 Page 5 of 9 d) All employee responsibilities in the FMLA for notice, medical certification, fitness for duty certification and notice of intent to return to work apply as specified in this policy and policy 7510. J. SCHOOL SYSTEM\u2019S DESIGNATION AND NOTICE TO EMPLOYEE 1. Whether or not the employee specifically asks for FMLA leave, it is the responsibility of the assistant superintendent of human resources or designee to ask any questions necessary of the employee in order to make a determination of whether the leave is FMLA-eligible, unless the employee has already requested and received FMLA leave or certification for the same condition or event. The assistant superintendent may require notice of the need and the reason for leave. 2. The director for human resources or designee shall provide all legally-required notices to the employee within five days of receiving this information or otherwise learning that an employee\u2019s leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, unless there is a justifiable delay, such as a delay for documentation. The required notices must indicate whether the employee is eligible under the FMLA. If the employee is eligible, the notice must specify any additional information required from the employee as well as the employee\u2019s rights and responsibilities under the FMLA. If the employee is not eligible, the notice must provide a reason for the ineligibility. The required notices also must include whether the leave will be designated as FMLA-protected and, if so, the amount of leave counted against the employee\u2019s leave entitlement. 3. Leave may be designated as both FMLA-eligible and as leave under the school system\u2019s paid leave policy if paid leave has been substituted. Such leave would be counted towards the 12-week FMLA entitlement. In addition, the director of human resources may designate an absence (taken as paid or unpaid leave) that meets the criteria for an FMLA-qualifying absence as part of the employee\u2019s total FMLA entitlement, whether or not the employee has requested FMLA leave. (See section M.) 4. Leave that has been taken for an FMLA-qualifying reason may be retroactively designated as FMLA leave, with appropriate notice to the employee, provided that doing so does not cause harm or injury to the employee. K. CERTIFICATION The school system reserves the right to require employees to provide certification of any FMLA-qualifying event or condition of the employee or the employee\u2019s spouse, child, parent or next of kin, including certification for military exigency leave. The school system will not request more medical certification information than that allowed by the FMLA and the Americans With Disabilities Act. The director of human resources or designee may request a second or third opinion at the school system\u2019s expense if reason Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520 Page 6 of 9 to doubt the validity of a medical certification exists. The school system may require periodic recertification to support the leave, as permitted by law. L. RETURN TO WORK The school system may require an employees to periodically report on his or her status and intent to return to work. Any employee who it taking leave through the end of an academic semester must report on his or her intent to return to work no later than four weeks before the end of the academic semester. In addition, the school system may require the employee to report on his or her intent to return to work on a regular basis while on FMLA leave. Before an employee returns to work from FMLA leave taken for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition, the employee must present a \"fitness-for-duty\" certification that states that the employee is able to return to work. This requirement does not apply to an employee taking intermittent leave unless the employee\u2019s condition presents a reasonable safety concern. M. SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE 1. The school system will substitute appropriate paid leave, including sick leave, personal leave and vacation time for unpaid, FMLA leave to the extent allowed by law and policy, giving proper notice to the employee that the leave is designated FMLA. If an employee\u2019s accrued paid leave is exhausted but an FMLA-qualifying reason for absence continues, the resulting absences will be protected FMLA leave until all allowable FMLA leave has been used, but such absences will be unpaid. 2. When an employee has an absence (taken as paid or unpaid leave) that meets the criteria for an FMLA-qualified absence, the absence may, with proper notice to the employee, be designated part of the employee\u2019s total annual FMLA entitlement. If the absence continues for more than 10 days, all employee responsibilities in the FMLA to provide notice for foreseeable and unforeseeable leave, medical certification, fitness for duty certification and notice of intent to return to work apply as specified in this policy and policy 7510. 3. An employee must not be permitted to exhaust paid leave before beginning FMLA leave if it has been determined that the employee\u2019s reason for using paid leave meets the FMLA eligibility requirements. N. RESTORATION TO EQUIVALENT POSITION 1. Generally Employees, except \"key\" employees, will be restored to the same or an equivalent position upon return from FMLA leave. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520 Page 7 of 9 The equivalent position will have virtually identical pay, benefits and working conditions, including privileges, prerequisites and status, as the position held prior to the leave. The position also must involve substantially similar duties and responsibilities, which must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, responsibility and authority. All positions within the same job classification are considered \"equivalent positions\" for purposes of this policy, so long as these conditions are met. For licensed employees, all positions with the same salary and licensure requirements also will be considered equivalent positions, so long as these conditions are met. 2. Key Employees Key employees do not have the right to be restored to the same or an equivalent position upon return from FMLA leave. Key employees are salaried FMLA-eligible employees who are among the highest paid 10 percent of all employees. If restoring a key employee would result in substantial and grievous economic injury to the school system, then the school system has no obligation to restore the employee to the same or an equivalent position. Employees will be informed at the time leave is taken if he or she is considered a key employees and will be informed once a determination is made that the employee will not be restored to the same or an equivalent position upon their return. A key employee who has been informed that he or she will not be restored still has the rights to health benefits for the full period in which he or she is eligible for FMLA leave. O. CONTINUATION OF HEALTH BENEFITS Health care coverage and benefits will be continued for the duration of an employee\u2019s FMLA leave on the same conditions as would have been provided if the employee had continued working. Employees do not have the right to the accrual of earned benefits during FMLA leave. If an employee takes intermittent or reduced leave, he or she has the right to maintain the same health care benefits, but earned benefits may be reduced in proportion to hours worked when such a reduction is normally based upon hours worked. The school system may recover from the employee the cost of health insurance premiums paid on behalf of the employee while the employee was on unpaid FMLA leave if the employee does not return to work after leave, so long as the reason for not returning does not relate to a serious health condition or to circumstances beyond the employee's control. P. POSTING REQUIREMENT The superintendent or designee shall ensure that notices of FMLA provisions and information on procedures for filing complaints are posted in places that are readily accessible to employees and applicants. Q. RECORD-KEEPING REQUIREMENT Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7520 Page 8 of 9 The personnel department shall maintain records of the following information for at least three years: basic payroll and identifying employee data, dates (or hours) of FMLA leave taken by each employee, and premium payments of employee benefits. Medical information, such as that relating to medical certifications, also will be maintained in the personnel department in confidential medical records. The director of human resources or designee will maintain for at least three years copies of employee notices, including general and specific notices, any other documents describing employee benefits or policies, and records of disputes between the school system and any employee regarding designation of FMLA leave. R. ENFORCEMENT An employee may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor or bring a private lawsuit against the school system for violations of the FMLA. FMLA does not affect any federal or state law prohibiting discrimination or supersede any state or local law that provides greater family or medical leave rights. S. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT/FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS The school system may deny FMLA benefits to an employee who engages in self- employment or employment for any employer while on continuous leave if the employee fraudulently obtained FMLA leave. Falsification of records and failure to correct records known to be false are violations of this policy and will result in discipline, which may include termination from employment.

Employees are encouraged to schedule short periods of required active duty during vacation periods so as not to interfere with regular duties of the individual's employment. A. Notice and Documentation Requirements 1. Employee must provide to the superintendent advance written or oral notice of any absences due to military obligations, except in cases of emergency assignment or other conditions that make notice impossible or unreasonable. 2. For leave periods exceeding 30 days, the employee must provide written documentation evidencing performance of military duty or identify the military command in order for the school to verify the request. B. Short-Term Military Leave with Pay 1. In accordance with State Board of Education policy, an employee who is a member of a reserve component of the U.S. Armed Forces may take up to 15 workdays of paid military leave f or active duty training per fiscal year, which runs from October 1 through September 30. Members of the National Guard may take additional paid leave beyond these 15 days for special state activities when so authorized by the governor. 2. After an employee has used all of his or her paid leave, the employee may choose to use any accumulated vacation leave, bonus leave, or comp time during the period of military service; however, no employee will be forced to use such paid leave during military service. C. Unpaid Military Leave for Extended Active Duty 1. Employees may take extended leaves of absence for state or federal military duty under honorable services status, for required training, or for special emergency management in accordance with state and federal law and State Board policy. Such leave is unpaid, except as described in paragraph C.2, below. The employee may use any available eligible paid leave prior to going on unpaid leave. 2. During periods of extended military leaves, which must not exceed five years cumulatively plus any period of additional service imposed by law, the employee will be paid the difference in military base pay and state salary, including non-performance-based bonuses, when the military pay is less than Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7530 Page 1 of 2 the state salary. Differential pay will be paid from the same source of funds as the employee\u2019s public school salary. An employee may not receive differential pay while absent on any type of paid leave. D. Reinstatement From Military Leave 1. If the individual applies for reinstatement following separation from military duty, his or her reemployment and related rights are governed by the provisions of the USERRA (for members of reserve components of the U.S. Armed Forces, including members of the North Carolina National Guard returning from active federal duty) or Article 16 of G.S. 127A (for members of the North Carolina National Guard returning from active state duty). 2. Employees must meet all applicable state or federal deadlines for reporting back to work or applying for reinstatement. 3. Under certain circumstances, an employee may receive teaching experience credit and retirement credit for service in the military, in accordance with State Board regulations. E. Explanation of Benefits When an employee is determined to be eligible for unpaid military leave under this policy, the superintendent or designee shall provide the employee with an explanation of his or her rights and benefits, including those related to leave, salary increases, medical insurance options, retirement status, the possibility of differential pay, and reinstatement rights. F. Compliance with Other Requirements The board will follow and apply all other applicable legal requirements when administering military leave under this policy.

The superintendent is directed to establish a return to work program that is consistent with federal and state law, board policy, and State Board of Education requirements. The objectives of the program will be to: assist employees who are recovering from a work-related temporary injury or illness to safely return to full duty without restrictions at the earliest possible time; assist recovering employees who have temporary work restrictions to return to a temporary, time-limited transitional work assignment of modified or alternate duties approved by the authorized health care provider, when practicable and in the best interests of the school system to do so; assist employees with permanent work restrictions to find suitable employment; and maintain close communication, coordination, and cooperation between the employee, school system representatives, and others working to expedite the employee\u2019s recovery and return to work. The superintendent shall provide specific procedures to guide all employees in carrying out the return-to-work program. All supervisory employees are expected to fully comply with the program procedures and to assist in meeting the program\u2019s objectives. Employees experiencing work-related injuries or illnesses shall fulfill all responsibilities assigned to them under the return- to-work program and shall fully comply with the applicable requirements of the North Carolina Workers Compensation Act.

In addition, the employee will be subject to disciplinary action to the extent consistent with law. This policy and any procedures developed by the superintendent to implement this policy are not intended to, and do not, confer any additional employment rights on any employee, including any right to a transitional duty assignment, nor will they be construed as recognition by the school system that any employee who participates in the return-to-work program has a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the North Carolina Persons with Disabilities Protection Act.

While there may be other conflicts of interests, employees must follow board directives in the following areas. FINANCIAL INTERESTS An employee shall not engage in selling goods or services to the board and shall not engage in or have a financial interest, directly or indirectly, in any activity that conflicts with duties and responsibilities in the school system. Contracts with the Board An employee shall not do any of the following: a) obtain a direct benefit from a contract that he or she is involved in making or administering on behalf of the board, unless an exception is allowed pursuant to G.S. 14-234 or other law; b) influence or attempt to influence anyone who is involved in making or administering a contract on behalf of the board; or c) solicit or receive any gift, favor, reward, service or promise of reward, including a promise of future employment, in exchange for recommending, influencing or attempting to influence the award of a contract by the board. An employee is involved in administering a contract if he or she oversees the performance of the contract or has authority to interpret or make decisions regarding the contract. An employee is involved in making a contract if he or she participates in the development of specifications or terms of the contract or participates in the preparation or award of the contract. An employee derives a direct benefit from a contract if the employee or his or her spouse does any of the following: (1) has more than a 10 percent ownership or other interest in an entity that is a party to the contract; (2) derives any income or commission directly from the contract; or (3) acquires property under the contract. Non-School Employment The board recognizes that some employees may, in their own time, pursue additional compensation. Any such employee shall not engage in the following: a) nonschool employment which adversely affects the employee's availability or Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7730 Page 1 of 2 effectiveness in fulfilling job responsibilities; b) work of any type in which the sources of information concerning customer, client or employer originates from any information obtained through the school district; c) work of any type that materially and negatively affects the educational program of the school system; d) any type of private business using system facilities, equipment or materials, unless prior approval is provided by the superintendent; or e) any type of private business during school time or on school property. The superintendent may grant prior approval for work performed under subsections d and e above if such work enhances the employee\u2019s professional ability or professional growth for school-related work.

The board further believes that students will not excel in performance unless those who most directly affect students, including administrators, teachers, and other licensed professionals, excel in their performance. It is the intent of the board to employ only those licensed employees who continuously exhibit a pattern of behavior that exemplifies excellent performance. The Avery County Board of Education places a high priority to securing the most competent personnel available and, once they are employed, in assisting them in their professional growth and development throughout their careers. An effective evaluation program that clearly describes an employee\u2019s performance is a critical aspect of professional growth and assistance. Further, performance evaluation data is an important factor for consideration in decisions regarding continued employment. The superintendent must be able to substantiate any recommendation for continued employment with evaluation data, among other factors. The superintendent is directed to develop and implement an effective evaluation system for licensed personnel that is consistent with State Board of Education policies. School administrators who are responsible for conducting evaluations shall comply with all state requirements in regard to the type and frequency of evaluation, including as applicable, the processes for evaluating licensed employees in schools designated as low performing. The school principal shall evaluate teachers. The superintendent or designee shall evaluate principals and assistant principals and may incorporate any guidelines or strategies developed by the State Board to assist in the evaluations. The superintendent or designee shall evaluate principals and assistant principals. All licensed personnel must be evaluated at least annually using state-approved evaluation instruments in conformance with the processes established by the State Board in the North Carolina Educator Evaluation System for that class of personnel. Teachers with fewer than three consecutive years of experience shall be evaluated annually in accordance with the comprehensive evaluation cycle established in State Board Policy EVAL-004. For teachers with three or more years of experience, the abbreviated evaluation process established in State Board Policy EVAL-004 satisfies the annual evaluation requirement; however, a teacher receiving an abbreviated evaluation may request that the evaluator conduct a formal observation. In addition, in any given year, the principal may elect to use the comprehensive or standard evaluation processes set forth in State Board Policy EVAL-004 or require additional formal or informal observations to evaluate a teacher with three or more ears of experience. The principal also may supplement the State Board evaluation processes for other categories of licensed by requiring additional observation or other evaluation measures. The annual evaluation of principals and assistant principals must include a mid-year review. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7810 Page 1 of 3 The evaluation system must incorporate the following directives. Evaluators must clearly identify exemplary performance as well as deficiencies in performance. Evaluators are encouraged to use supplementary means of assessing and documenting performance in addition to the state performance standards, assessment rubrics, and evaluation instruments, including, but not limited to, additional formal observations, informal observations, conferences, review of lesson plans and grade books, interactions with the employee, plans of growth or improvement, and any other accurate indicators of performance. Student performance and growth data will be considered as a part of the evaluation of licensed personnel, as provided in the assessment rubric for the class of employees under evaluation. For teachers, such data shall include analysis of student work for performance-based courses and student performance as measured by the statewide growth model for educator effectiveness or as otherwise authorized by the State Board of Education and approved by the local board. Multiple means of assessing student performance must be used whenever possible. If only one method of measurement of student performance is used, it must be a clearly valid tool for evaluating an employee\u2019s impact on student performance. Peer observations of teachers with fewer than three years of experience must be conducted as required by law using the evaluation instrument and process established by the State Board and must be considered by the school administrator in evaluating teacher performance. Supervisors and principals should facilitate open communication with employees about performance expectations. An employee who is unclear about how performance is being assessed or desires additional evaluation opportunities should address these issues with the immediate supervisor. Evaluators will be held accountable for following the evaluation system and all applicable state guidelines on the evaluation of employees. Evaluation data will be submitted to the central office personnel file in accordance with state law and board policy on personnel files (policy 7820, Professional and Staff Development). Evaluation data will be used in making employment decisions, including decisions related to Professional Staff Development (policy 1610/7800), career status (policy 7410) and suspension, demotion and dismissal of employees (policies 7930 and 7940). Employment decisions may be made by the board and Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7810 Page 2 of 3 administration regardless of whether the evaluation system has been followed by evaluators, so long as there is a legally sufficient basis for the decisions. The superintendent and all evaluators are encouraged to develop ways to recognize distinguished performance and to capitalize on the abilities of exemplary employees in helping other employees. The superintendent and evaluators are encouraged to involve employees in developing these processes. The superintendent shall develop any other necessary procedures and shall provide training, as necessary, to carry out the board directives and to meet state requirements.

If an employee does not meet this standard, the superintendent and administrative staff shall address any identified performance or other deficiencies through appropriate means, including placing the employee on a monitored growth, directed growth, or mandatory improvement plan when required by state law, State Board policy or this policy, or when otherwise deemed necessary. Growth and mandatory improvement plans as defined by law and this policy are valuable tools to promote the professional development of licensed employees.

A teacher who is performing below a proficient level on the Teacher Summary Rating Form shall be placed on a monitored growth plan or a directed growth plan unless dismissal, demotion, nonrenewal, or placement on a mandatory improvement plan (see Section C, below) is warranted. A monitored growth plan developed in accordance with State Board policy is required for a teacher who is rated \u201cdeveloping\u201d on one or more standards of the North Carolina Teacher Evaluation Rubric. State Board policy also requires that a teacher who is rated \u201cnot demonstrated\u201d on any standard or who is rated \u201cdeveloping\u201d on any standard for two sequential years be placed on a directed growth plan. The superintendent may establish other criteria that will be deemed evidence that performance is below a proficient level or otherwise represents unsatisfactory or below standard performance and warrants placement on either a monitored growth plan or a directed growth plan. Unless otherwise limited by state law or State Board policy, the principal is authorized to place a teacher on a monitored or directed growth plan or other plan of improvement at any point during the school year if the principal determines that the teacher is performing below the expected level. b. School Administrators Professional growth plans will be developed for school administrators as provided in State Board policy. A professional growth plan will include mutually agreed upon performance goals and recommendations based upon the school administrator\u2019s self-assessment, the consolidated assessment and the summary evaluation using the North Carolina School Executive; Principal and Assistant Principal Evaluation Process. Development of the professional growth plan will be discussed at a meeting between the school administrator and the superintendent or designee when completing the annual evaluation process. The superintendent may move to dismiss or demote a licensed employee whether or not the employee has been first placed on a growth or other improvement plan. See policy 7930, Professional Employees: Demotion and Dismissal. 2. Components of Growth Plans Individual growth plans may contain, but are not limited to, any of the components listed below. However, monitored or directed growth plans must include at least the following components. BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 2 of 7 Policy Code: 7811 a. Identification of Deficiencies All performance deficiencies, including all specific standards and elements of the Teacher Evaluation Rubric identified for improvement during the teacher\u2019s evaluation, must be identified and addressed in the growth plan. b. Performance Expectations and Goals For each problem identified, the growth plan must include a statement of the expected level of performance and/or other goals to be accomplished. c. Strategies The growth plan must set forth a strategy or strategies designed to correct each identified deficiency. The strategies should be specific and clearly state the activities the teacher should undertake to achieve the expected level of performance. The strategies also should identify all individuals responsible for implementing the plan. d. Dates for Monitoring and Completion The growth plan must include dates upon which the teacher\u2019s progress under the plan will be reviewed and the date by which performance is to be improved to the expected level. Under a monitored growth plan, the teacher must achieve proficiency within one school year. A directed growth plan may provide for a shorter period to achieve proficiency, not to exceed one school year. 3. Review of Growth Plans Individual and professional growth plans should be reviewed at least annually with the licensed employee\u2019s supervisor and/or the principal, the superintendent, or their designees, as applicable. In the case of a teacher\u2019s monitored or directed growth plan, once the designated time period for completion of a plan has elapsed, the principal or supervisor shall review the teacher\u2019s performance, including the results of any subsequent evaluation and determine whether the teacher continues to perform below the expected level in any area or whether the teacher\u2019s performance has improved sufficiently. If the teacher\u2019s performance remains below proficient, the principal or supervisor shall recommend to the superintendent one of the following: a. the board dismiss the teacher or demote or transfer the teacher to a position in which the teacher can be successful; BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 3 of 7 Policy Code: 7811 b. the teacher be placed on a mandatory improvement plan in accordance with the provisions of Section C below; or c. the teacher be moved to a new monitored or directed growth plan or continue on a previous growth plan that has been revised as necessary, provided the principal or supervisor determines that: 1) the teacher\u2019s continuing performance problems are not having an adverse impact on student learning or the school environment, or 2) the teacher is making good progress toward improvement in deficient areas and is likely to improve to an acceptable level within a reasonable, additional time period. C. MANDATORY IMPROVEMENT PLANS A mandatory improvement plan is an instrument designed to improve a licensed employee\u2019s performance by providing the employee with notice of specific performance areas that have substantial deficiencies and a set of strategies, including the specific support to be provided to the employee, so that he or she may satisfactorily resolve such deficiencies within a reasonable timeframe. The use of mandatory improvement plans as provided in this policy is discretionary and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Nothing in this policy will be interpreted so as to require the use of mandatory improvement plans in addition to, or in lieu of, growth plans or other disciplinary action, including dismissal from employment as provided by law. 1. Initiating a Mandatory Improvement Plan a. Licensed Employees in Low-Performing Schools If a licensed employee in a low-performing school receives a rating on any standard on an evaluation that is below proficient or otherwise represents unsatisfactory or below standard performance in an area that the licensed employee was expected to demonstrate, the individual or team that conducted the evaluation shall recommend to the superintendent that (i) the employee receive a mandatory improvement plan designed to improve the employee\u2019s performance or (ii) the superintendent recommend to the board that the employee be dismissed or demoted. If the individual or team that conducted the evaluation elects not to make either of the above recommendations, the said individual or team shall notify the superintendent of this decision. The superintendent shall determine whether to develop a mandatory improvement plan or to recommend a dismissal proceeding. BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 4 of 7 Policy Code: 7811 b. Teachers in Schools Not Identified as Low-Performing If, in an observation report or year-end evaluation, a teacher in a school not identified as low-performing receives a rating that is below proficient or otherwise represents unsatisfactory or below standard performance on any standard that the teacher was expected to demonstrate, the principal may place the employee on a mandatory improvement plan. The mandatory improvement plan will be utilized only if the superintendent or designee determines that an individual, monitored or directed growth plan would not satisfactorily address the deficiencies. c. Any Licensed Employees Engaging in Inappropriate Conduct or Performance A principal may recommend to the superintendent or designee that a licensed employee be placed immediately on a mandatory improvement plan if the employee engages in inappropriate conduct or performs inadequately to such a degree that the conduct or performance causes substantial harm to the educational environment, but immediate dismissal or demotion of the employee is not appropriate. The principal must document the exigent reason for immediately instituting such a plan. 2. Components of the Plan A mandatory improvement plan for any licensed employee must include the following components. a. Identification of Deficiencies The performance areas in which the employee is deficient must be identified and addressed in the mandatory improvement plan. b. Performance Expectations For each problem identified, the plan must include a statement of the expected level of performance. c. Strategies The plan must establish a strategy or strategies designed to correct each identified deficiency. The strategies should be specific and clearly state the activities the employee should undertake to achieve the expected level of performance and the specific support to be provided to the employee. The strategies also should identify all individuals responsible for implementing the plan. BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 5 of 7 Policy Code: 7811 d. Dates for Monitoring and Completion The plan must include dates upon which the employee\u2019s progress under the plan will be reviewed and the date by which performance is to be improved to the expected level. 3. Development and Implementation of the Plan a. Licensed Employees in Low-Performing Schools When directed by the superintendent, a mandatory improvement plan to improve the performance of a licensed employee will be developed by the person who evaluated the licensed employee or the employee\u2019s supervisor, unless the evaluation was conducted by an assistance team. If the evaluation was conducted by an assistance team, that team shall develop the mandatory improvement plan in collaboration with the employee\u2019s supervisor. Mandatory improvement plans will be designed to be completed within 90 instructional days or before the beginning of the next school year. b. Teachers in Schools Not Identified As Low-Performing When a principal decides to put a teacher on a mandatory improvement plan, the principal shall develop the plan in consultation with the teacher. The teacher shall have five instructional days after receiving the plan to request a modification to the plan before it is implemented. The principal must consider the requested modification before finalizing the plan. The teacher shall have at least 60 instructional days to complete the mandatory improvement plan. A teacher has five workdays after finalization of the mandatory improvement plan within which to submit a request to the principal for a qualified observer, as defined in G.S. 115C-333.1(c)(1), to observe the teacher in the area or areas of concern identified in the plan. In accordance with G.S. 115C-333.1(c)(2), the board will create and maintain a list of qualified observers who are employed by the board and available to conduct observations. The board will strive to limit the list to administrators and teachers who have excellent reputations for competence and fairness. Selection of the qualified observer and submission of the qualified observer\u2019s report to the principal will be in accordance with G.S. 115C-333.1(c)(3). 4. Reassessment a. Licensed Employees in Low-Performing Schools BOARD OF EDUCATION POLICY MANUAL Page 6 of 7 Policy Code: 7811 After the expiration of the time period for the mandatory improvement plan, the superintendent or designee or the assistance team shall assess the employee\u2019s performance. If the assessor determines that the employee has failed to become proficient in any of the performance standards articulated in the mandatory improvement plan or to demonstrate sufficient improvement toward such standards, the superintendent shall recommend that the employee be dismissed or demoted under applicable state law. b. Teachers in Schools Not Identified As Low-Performing Upon completion of a mandatory improvement plan, the principal or supervisor shall assess the performance of the employee. For teachers, the principal shall also review and consider any report provided by the qualified observer if one has been submitted before the end of the mandatory improvement plan period. If, after the assessment of the employee and consideration of any report from the qualified observer, the superintendent or designee determines that the teacher has failed to become proficient in any of the performance standards identified as deficient in the mandatory improvement plan or demonstrate sufficient improvement toward such standards, the superintendent may recommend that the employee be dismissed or demoted under applicable state law.

Supervisors and principals should facilitate open communication with employees about performance expectations. An employee who is unclear about how performance is being assessed or desires additional evaluation opportunities should address these issues with the immediate supervisor. Evaluation data will be submitted to the central office personnel file in accordance with state law and board policy on personnel files, (policy 7820). Evaluation data may be used in making employment decisions, including transfers, promotions and dismissal and demotion of employees, (board policy 7940). The superintendent and all evaluators are encouraged to develop ways to recognize exemplary employees and to capitalize on the abilities of exemplary employees in helping other employees. The superintendent will develop any other necessary procedures and will provide training, as necessary, to carry out the board directives.

The superintendent and all supervisors are directed to ensure that all appropriate employment-related information is submitted to the files. Employees will be provided all procedural protections as provided by law. The superintendent has overall responsibility for granting or denying access to personnel records consistent with this policy. A. RECORDS MAINTAINED The following records must be maintained in the personnel file: 1. evaluation reports made by the administration; 2. commendations for and complaints against the employee (see Section C); 3. written suggestions for corrections and improvements made by the administration; 4. certificates; 5. employee\u2019s standard test scores; 6. employee\u2019s academic records; 7. application forms; 8. any request to the State Board of Education to revoke the employee's teaching license; and 9. other pertinent records or reports.

The superintendent shall designate which school officials have a need to know the results of the criminal Avery County Schools Policy Code 7820 Page 1 of 6 Avery County Schools Policy Policy Code 7820 history check. Only those officials so designated may obtain access to the records. Medical Information Employee medical information, including the following, must be kept in a separate confidential file and may be subject to special disclosure rules: a. health certificates (see board policy 7120, Employee Health Certificates); b. drug test results, except that drug use or alcohol use contrary to board policy or law also may be documented in the employee's personnel file (see board policy 7241, Drug and Alcohol Testing of Commercial Motor Vehicle Operators); c. information related to an employee\u2019s communicable disease/condition or possible occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens (see board policies 7260, Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens, and 7262, Communicable Diseases \u2013 Employees); d. medical information related to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (see board policy 7520, Family and Medical Leave); and e. genetic information, as defined by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. Complaints/Reports of Harassment or Discrimination The superintendent or his or her designee shall maintain records of all reports and complaints of harassment and discrimination and the resolution of such complaints.

Employees involved in the allegations shall be identified only to individuals who need the information to investigate or resolve the matter or to ensure that due process is provided to the accused employee. (See board policies 1710/4021/7230, Prohibition Against Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying, and 1755/7237, Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedure.) If the allegations are substantiated through investigation, the superintendent or designee shall ensure that the provisions of Section C, below, are followed to the extent that they do not conflict with the rights of any individual. C. PLACEMENT OF RECORDS IN PERSONNEL FILE All evaluations, commendations, complaints or suggestions for correction or improvement must be placed in the employee's central office personnel file after the following requirements are met: the comment is signed and dated by the person making the evaluation, commendation, complaint or suggestion; if the comment is a complaint, the employee's supervisor has attempted to resolve the issue raised therein and documentation of such efforts is attached with the supervisor\u2019s Avery County Schools Policy Code 7820 Page 2 of 6 Avery County Schools Policy Policy Code 7820 recommendation to the superintendent as to whether the complaint contains any invalid, irrelevant, outdated or false information; and 3. the employee has received a copy of the evaluation, commendation, complaint or suggestion five days before it is placed in the file. All written complaints that are signed and dated must be submitted regardless of whether the supervisor considers the complaint to be resolved. The supervisor is expected to use good judgment in determining when documents should be submitted to the file immediately and when a delay is justified, such as when there exists a plan of improvement that is frequently revised. However, all evaluations, commendations, complaints or suggestions for correction or improvement should be submitted by the end of the school year or in time to be considered in an evaluation process, whichever is sooner. The supervisor or principal should seek clarification from the director of human resources as necessary to comply with this policy. The employee may offer a denial or explanation of the evaluation, commendation, complaint or suggestion, and any such denial or explanation will become part of his or her personnel file, provided that it is signed and dated. The superintendent may exercise statutory authority not to place in an employee\u2019s file a letter of complaint that contains invalid, irrelevant, outdated or false information or a letter of complaint when there is no documentation of an attempt to resolve the issue. As provided in policy 7900, Resignation, if a career employee who has been recommended for dismissal under the applicable state law resigns without the written consent of the superintendent, then: (1) the superintendent shall report the matter to the State Board of Education; (2) the employee shall be deemed to have consented to the placement of the written notice of the superintendent\u2019s intention to recommend dismissal in the employee\u2019s personnel file; and (3) the employee shall be deemed to have consented to the release to prospective employers, upon request, of the fact that the superintendent has reported this employee to the State Board of Education. For purposes of this provision, \u201ccareer employee\u201d means (1) a teacher or an administrator with career status, or (2) an administrator or a non-career status teacher during the term of his or her contract. D. ACCESS TO PERSONNEL FILE 1.

This policy applies to (1) employees with career status and (2) all other teachers and school administrators, as defined in the relevant statutes, during the terms of their contracts. A reduction in force among any other employees will be accomplished in accordance with policy 7921, Classified Personnel Reduction, or, as applicable, in accordance with any conflicting terms of an individual employee\u2019s contract. A. Grounds for Reduction in Force A reduction in force may be implemented when the board determines that any of the following circumstances have resulted in the need to decrease the number of positions held by employees to whom this policy applies. 1. System Reorganization System reorganization is defined as (a) the closing, consolidation, or reorganization of schools, school buildings, or facilities; (b) the elimination, curtailment, or reorganization of a curriculum offering, program, or school operation; or (c) the merger of two or more school systems. 2. Declining Enrollment Declining enrollment exists (a) when the enrollment or projected enrollment for the next succeeding school year causes a decrease in the number of teaching or administrative positions allocated by the State or any other funding source; or (b) when the enrollment or projected enrollment of a curriculum offering or program for the next succeeding school year is inadequate to justify continuation of the course or program. 3. Financial Exigency Financial exigency means (a) any significant decline in the board's financial resources that compels a reduction in the school system's current operational budget; (b) any significant decrease or elimination in funding for a particular program; or (c) any insufficiency in funding that would render the board unable to continue existing programs at current levels. B. Preliminary Determination 1. The superintendent shall determine whether or not a reduction in force for employees subject to this policy is necessary, appropriate, or in the best interests of the school system. Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7920 Page 1 of 3 2. If the superintendent decides to recommend to the board a reduction in force, he or she shall first determine which positions shall be subject to the reduction. In making that determination, the superintendent shall account for both: a. structural considerations, such as identifying positions, departments, courses, programs, operations, and other areas where there are (1) less essential, duplicative, or excess personnel; (2) job responsibility and/or position inefficiencies; (3) opportunities for combined work functions; and/or (4) decreased student or other demands for curriculum, programs, operations, or other services; and b. organizational considerations, such as anticipated organizational needs of the school system and program/school enrollment. 3. The superintendent shall then present a recommendation to the board. The recommendation must include: a. the grounds for a reduction in force; b. the positions to be reduced, categorized by area(s) of licensure and/or program responsibility; and c. the background information, data, and rationale for the recommendation. 4. The board will review the superintendent's recommendation and will determine whether to reduce the number of employees or to reduce their terms of employment. 5. If the board, after exploring, considering, and discussing a variety of ways to avoid a reduction in force, determines that a reduction in force of employees subject to this policy is necessary, the superintendent shall recommend to the board which individuals are to be dismissed, demoted, or reduced to part-time employment, based on the criteria set forth below. C. Criteria The primary consideration in any reduction in force will be the maintenance of a sound and balanced educational program that is consistent with the functions and responsibilities of the school system. The superintendent shall consider a variety of factors in determining which employees will be included in the reduction in force, including the following: 1. work performance and evaluation ratings; 2. areas of licensure; 3. highly qualified status; 4. program enrollment; 5. service in extra duty positions and ability to fill such positions; Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7920 Page 2 of 3 6. length of service, with higher priority given to service in this school system; and 7. degree level. The superintendent shall develop a system for using the above-mentioned factors to determine which employees will be recommended to the board for inclusion in the reduction in force. D. Procedure for Termination The board will consider the superintendent's recommendation and may, by resolution, order dismissal or demotion of an individual or reduce an individual to part-time employment. All requirements of G.S. 115C-325 (for teachers with career status) and 115C-325.6 (for non-career status teachers) will be met, including the time limits and procedures for notice and the opportunity for a hearing, when any teacher with career status (as defined in G.S. 115C-325) or teacher or administrator (as defined in G.S. 115C-325.1) is terminated, demoted, or reduced to part-time employment due to a reduction in force. E. Termination/Reemployment of a Teacher with Career Status When a teacher with career status is dismissed in accordance with this policy, his or her name will be placed on a list of available employees to be maintained by the board. F. Nonrenewal of an Employee The board, upon recommendation of the superintendent, may refuse to renew the contract of a non-career status teacher; to offer a new, renewed, or extended contract to a school administrator; or to reemploy any non-career status teacher who is not under contract for any cause it deems sufficient (see policy 7950, Non-Career Status Teachers: Nonrenewal). A decision (1) not to renew a non-career status teacher's contract, (2) not to renew, extend, or offer a new contract to a school administrator, or (3) to not reemploy any non-career status teacher who is not under contract is not considered a \"termination\" under this policy. In such circumstances the procedures set forth in this policy are not required to be followed before the board's decision.

These conditions could result from such situations as district reorganization, decreased enrollment, and decreased funding. The superintendent with prior board approval may terminate or reduce the term of employment of non-certified/classified employees in order to reduce staff. In such circumstances, the following procedure will apply: The primary consideration for termination or the term of employment shall be the maintenance of a sound and balanced educational program that is consistent with the functions and responsibilities of the school system. When possible, staff reduction will be accomplished through normal attrition, resignations, retirements, and voluntary transfers. When staff reduction cannot be accomplished in the above manner a reduction in force may occur. The superintendent will recommend reductions in force to the board based upon the following criteria: a. job performance as indicated on formal evaluations and other documentation; b. degrees, licenses or other indicators of an employee's potential to contribute and progress in the school district; c. seniority in the same positions within the district as a whole; d. other criteria determined to be relevant by the superintendent. The superintendent, in making the final recommendation to the Board of Education, will use his or her discretion in weighing these factors. The board will approve, disapprove or modify the superintendent's recommendation for reduction in force. All employees affected by the reduction will be notified in writing of the board's decision. Such notice will include information regarding the opportunity for any employee terminated pursuant to this policy to submit his or her name for other positions as they become open. Such submission does not offer any guarantee of employment; however, every consideration will be given for appropriate reemployment.

The board expects all professionally licensed employees, whether employed pursuant to a contract or through continuing career status, to exemplify above-average performance in carrying out their teaching or other professional responsibilities. Such employees are expected to continue to strive for excellence, meet all performance standards established by the board, and pursue professional development as provided in policy 1610/7800, Professional and Staff Development. Any professionally licensed employee who is unable or unwilling to meet the performance expectations or other reasonable standards of the board may be subject to demotion or dismissal as provided in this policy. Evaluators of licensed employees are expected to follow policy 7810, Evaluation of Licensed Employees, policy 7820, Personnel Files and policy 7811, Plans for Growth and Improvement of Licensed Employees. Evaluators should provide the superintendent with carefully documented evidence concerning a person's inadequacies and lack of competencies when such deficiencies have led to the recommendation and contemplation of dismissal or demotion. These documents also should show ways in which the evaluator has endeavored to help the employee become a more effective professional. In the interest of students and the welfare of the school district, dismissal or demotion may be pursued regardless of whether the evaluator has met these expectations and regardless of whether the employee has first been placed on a growth plan or mandatory improvement plan, so long as the legal grounds for seeking dismissal or demotion can be sufficiently demonstrated. All legally required procedures, including those prescribed the applicable state law, will be followed in the dismissal or demotion of employees. Career status teachers, non-career status teachers during the terms of their contracts, and school administrators during the terms of their contracts may be dismissed only for the following reasons: 1. inadequate performance, as defined by the applicable state statute; 2. immorality; 3. insubordination; 4. neglect of duty; 5. physical or mental incapacity; 6. habitual or excessive use of alcohol or non-medical use of a controlled substance as defined in Article 5, Chapter 90 of the General Statutes; 7. conviction of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude; 8. advocating the overthrow of the government of the United States or of the state of North Carolina by force, violence, or other unlawful means; 9. failure to fulfill the duties and responsibilities imposed upon teachers or school administrators by the General Statutes; Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7930 Page 1 of 1 10. failure to comply with such reasonable requirements as the board may prescribe; 11. any cause that constitutes grounds for the revocation of an employee\u2019s teaching or school administrator license; 12. a justifiable decrease in the number of positions due to school system reorganization, decreased enrollment, or decreased funding, provided that there is full compliance with other statutory requirements; 13. failure to maintain one\u2019s license in current status; 14. failure to repay money owed to the state in accordance with the provisions of Article 60, Chapter 143 of the General Statutes; and 15. providing false information or knowingly omitting a material fact on an application for employment or in response to a pre-employment inquiry.

Classified positions are critical to the effective operation of the Avery County School District. The board encourages open communication between classified employees and their supervisors. When performance problems arise, supervisors are encouraged to clearly communicate in oral or written form the nature of the deficiencies and to provide a reasonable opportunity to improve. Any written notices or reprimands will be included in the employee's central office personnel file. All employees are expected to meet job requirements and to seek clarification and guidance when needed to fulfill these requirements. SUSPENSION The superintendent or his or her designee may suspend an employee without pay as a disciplinary sanction. The superintendent will provide written notice of the suspension without pay to the employee. This notice will be placed in the personnel file. The suspension without pay may begin immediately. An employee has ten calendar days from the date of receiving written notice to request an appeal before the board of education regarding the decision to suspend without pay. If an appeal is not made within this time, an appeal is deemed to be waived. An employee may appeal a suspension on the basis that there was no rational basis for the suspension; the suspension was discriminatory or was used for harassment; or board policies were not followed. Upon receiving a request for an appeal, the chairperson may designate a panel of three board members to review the decision. The chairperson of the board or the panel may establish rules for an orderly and efficient hearing. The employee will be notified in writing of the decision of the board to uphold, reverse or modify the superintendent's decision. An employee will receive back pay for any period of suspension without pay that is not upheld by the board.

The contract may be amended by a change order, but some change orders may not be used to evade bidding requirements. When amendments to a contract are necessary, the contractor shall submit a proposed change order in writing to the superintendent or designee. Any request for expedited review must also be in writing and accompany the proposed change order. Unless otherwise prohibited by statute or regulation, the superintendent or designee is authorized to approve or deny change orders involving sums up to $1000 so long as funding for the change order is available within the established project budget. The superintendent shall report all such change order requests and whether they were approved or denied to the board at the next regular board meeting. Change orders which involve amounts over $1000 or are in excess of the remaining funds in the project budget require board approval. The superintendent shall report to the board at the next regular board meeting all such proposed change orders, along with the superintendent\u2019s recommendation whether to approve each change order. However, the superintendent shall report to the board within 48 hours any change orders that include a request by the contractor for expedited review or that, in the superintendent\u2019s opinion, require expedited Avery County Schools Policy Code: 9030 Page 1 of 1 review.

GENERAL 1. The Avery County School Board recognizes that the purpose of this prequalification process is to impartially evaluate a contractor, and to properly determine by its responsible business practices, work experience, manpower, and equipment that it is qualified to bid on a board construction project, including prime contracts awarded by construction managers pursuant to the Construction Manager at Risk (\u201cCM at Risk\u201d) process. The award of contracts should be the result of open competition in bidding; impartiality in the selection of contractors; integrity in business practices; and skillful performance of public contracts. 2. The administration shall be responsible for prequalifying individual contractors to bid on board construction projects when the administration believes prequalification is preferred. The administration is not required to prequalify contractors for any particular project or projects. However, a contractor shall not be allowed to submit a bid on a construction project subject to prequalification, unless it has been prequalified in accordance with board policy. 3. The construction manager and the administration shall jointly develop the assessment tool and criteria for each CM at Risk project, including the prequalification scoring values and minimum requirement score. The construction manager shall use the process outlined in this policy for the prequalification of contractors on CM at Risk projects. 4. Notwithstanding the fact that a contractor was prequalified, the board, administration, and construction manager reserve the right to reject a contractor\u2019s bid if it is determined that the contractor has not submitted the lowest responsible and responsive bid. The prequalification of the contractor shall not preclude the board, administration, or construction manager from subsequently concluding that the contractor is not a responsible bidder pursuant to G.S. 143-129. The prequalification of a contract for a project shall only apply to the individual project. All construction and repair contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder, taking into consideration quality, performance, and the time specified in the proposals for the performance of the contract.

Adopted: 5/9/11 Avery County Schools Policy Code: 9201 Page 3 of 3","title":"9201   Energy Conservation"},{"location":"Policies/9000 Series/9205 - Pest Management/","text":"Avery County Schools Policy Policy Code: 9205 PEST MANAGEMENT The Avery County Board of Education strives to provide a safe and orderly environment for students. Pests are significant problems for people and property. The pesticides that are commonly used in pest control may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment. The board is committed to maintaining a safe educational environment while also protecting the physical conditions of school facilities. To this end, the board will utilize Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs or incorporate IPM procedures into the maintenance program conducted by the school system. The superintendent will appoint an IPM contact person to facilitate the use of IPM techniques. As necessary, the superintendent will develop administrative procedures for the IPM program. A. OVERVIEW OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT IPM is a comprehensive approach that combines effective, economic, environmentally sound and socially acceptable methods to prevent and solve pest problems. IPM emphasizes pest prevention and provides a decision-making process for determining if, when and where pest suppression is needed and what control tactics are appropriate. The school system\u2019s IPM program will strive to do the following: \u2022 Minimize any potential health, environmental and economic risks from pests or from the use of pest control methods; \u2022 Minimize loss or damage to school structures or property from pests or from the use of pest control methods; \u2022 Minimize the risk of pests spreading into the community; and \u2022 Enhance the quality of facility use for the school and community. Pesticides will not be used based solely on a schedule. School personnel in charge of pest management will consider how and when pesticides need to be used to achieve the pest management goals. B. USE OF IPM IN FACILITY AND MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS The school system shall include pest management considerations in facilities planning and maintenance. The IPM contact person, in conjunction with the school system\u2019s contracted pest management professional, will recommend to the superintendent any landscaping changes, structural modifications and sanitation changes needed to reduce or prevent pest problems. The superintendent will Avery County Schools Policy Code: 7321R Page 1 of 2 review such recommendations and may authorize action to address necessary minor changes in a timely manner, as the budget permits. For significant changes or changes that require a significant expenditure of funds, the superintendent will recommend changes to the board for approval. C. PROVIDING INFORMATION ON IPM TO THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY Staff, students, pest managers, parents and the public will be informed about potential school pest problems, school IPM policies and procedures, and their respective roles in achieving the desired pest management objectives. Each year, the principal or designee will ensure that the student handbook includes the schedule of anticipated pesticide use on school property and a notice to parents of their right to request notification of nonscheduled pesticide use. Notice of nonscheduled pesticide use should be made at least 72 hours in advance, to the extent possible. D. RECORDKEEPING Records of all pest management activities must be maintained, including inspection records, monitoring records, pest surveillance data sheets or other indicators of pest populations, and a record of structural repairs and modifications. If pesticides are used, records must be maintained on site to meet the requirements of the state regulatory agency and school board.

The hearing shall be before the Superintendent or his/her designee and shall be conducted as follows: 1. Closed Hearing. The hearing will be informal and will be conducted in private. 2. Representation. In addition to the Superintendent or designee, the hearing may be attended by the Principal and administrative assistants, the student, the student\u2019s parents/guardians and, if desired, a representative and any other persons the Superintendent or designee deems necessary.

Formal rules of evidence do not apply and the Superintendent or designee may rely on evidence that a reasonably prudent person would consider in the conduct of serious affairs. 5. Access to Student Education Records. The student\u2019s parent/guardian shall have access to a copy of the student\u2019s education records and all witness statements prior to the hearing.
